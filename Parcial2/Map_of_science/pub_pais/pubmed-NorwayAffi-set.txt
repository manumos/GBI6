AB  - Circular bioeconomy has become a sustainable business model for commercial 
      production that promises to reuse, recycle & recover while considering less 
      environmental footprints in nutraceutical industries. Microalgae biotechnology has 
      the synergy to bioremediate waste stream while generating high-value-added compounds 
      such as astaxanthin, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are potential 
      compounds used in various industries, thus, the integration of this approach 
      provides economic advantages. However, since the industrial production of these 
      compounds is costly and affected byunstable climate in the Nordic regions such as 
      low temperature, light intensity, and polar circle, the focus of biosynthesis has 
      shifted from less tolerant commercial strains towards indigenous strains. 
      Nutraceutical productions such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and protein can now be 
      synthesized at low temperatures which significantly improve the industry's economy. 
      In this review, the above-mentioned compounds with potential strains were discussed 
      based on a Nordic region's perspective.

AB  - Conventional and organic cinnamon and peppermint were investigated for their 
      phenolic profile, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. 
      Accelerated solvent extraction with 75% acetone was used to extract samples. Caffeic 
      acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in peppermint. Catechin, 
      (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, syringic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, and 
      p-coumaric acid were also detected in both spices. There was no significant 
      difference between conventional and organic spices in the composition of most 
      individual phenolics. All conventional and organic peppermint and cinnamon extracts 
      exhibited strong anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Cinnamon was 
      more efficient in inhibiting IL-1β and COX-2 expression, while peppermint showed 
      better inhibitory effect on IL-6 and MCP-1. This study indicates that cinnamon and 
      peppermint may potentially be used as dietary sources of bioactive phytochemicals 
      for improving health.

TI  - Nutraceutical Characterization of Anthocyanin-Rich Fruits Produced by "Sun Black" 
      Tomato Line.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most cultivated vegetable in the 
      world and it represents a large source of bioactive compounds, including carotenoids 
      and polyphenols (phenolic acids and flavonoids). However, the concentration of 
      flavonoids in tomato is considered sub-optimal, particularly because anthocyanins 
      are not generally present. Therefore, this crop has been the object of an intense 
      metabolic engineering in order to obtain anthocyanin-enriched tomatoes by using 
      either breeding or transgenic strategies. Some wild tomato species, such as S. 
      chilense and S. cheesmaniae, biosynthesize anthocyanins in the fruit sub-epidermal 
      tissue, and some alleles from those genotypes have been introgressed into a new 
      developed purple tomato line, called "Sun Black" (SB). It is a tomato line with a 
      purple skin color, both in green and in red fruit stages, due to the biosynthesis of 
      anthocyanins in the peel, and a normal red color pulp, with a taste just like a 
      traditional tomato. SB is the result of a breeding programme and it is not a 
      genetically modified (GM) product. We report the chemical characterization and 
      structure elucidation of the attractive anthocyanins found in the peel of SB tomato, 
      as well as other bioactive compounds (carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamin C) of the 
      whole fruit. Using one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments, the two main 
      anthocyanins were identified to be petunidin 
      3-O-[6″-O-(4(‴)-O-E-p-coumaroyl-α-rhamnopyranosyl) 
      -β-glucopyranoside]-5-O-β-glucopyranoside (petanin) and malvidin 
      3-O-[6″-O-(4(‴)-O-E-p-coumaroyl-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside]-5-O-β-glucopyranoside 
      (negretein). The total anthocyanins in the whole ripe fruit was 1.2 mg/g dry weight 
      (DW); 7.1 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW). Chlorogenic acid (the most abundant phenolic 
      acid) was 0.6 mg/g DW; 3.7 mg/100 g FW. The main flavonol, rutin was 0.8 mg/g DW; 5 
      mg/100 g FW. The total carotenoid content was 211.3 μg/g DW; 1,268 μg/100 g FW. The 
      total phenolic content was 8.6 mg/g DW; 52.2 mg/100 g FW. The vitamin C content was 
      37.3 mg/100 g FW. The antioxidant activities as measured by the TEAC and ORAC assays 
      were 31.6 and 140.3 μmol TE/g DW, respectively (193 and 855.8 μmol TE/100 g FW, 
      respectively). The results show the unique features of this new tomato genotype with 
      nutraceutical properties.

TI  - Nutraceutical with Resveratrol and Omega-3 Fatty Acids Induces Autophagy in ARPE-19 
      Cells.
LID - 10.3390/nu8050284 [doi]
LID - 284
AB  - Impaired autophagic and proteasomal cleansing have been documented in aged retinal 
      pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Omega-3 
      fatty acids and resveratrol have many positive homeostatic effects in RPE cells. In 
      this work, ARPE-19 cells were treated with 288 ng of Resvega, containing 30 mg of 
      trans resveratrol and 665 mg of omega-3 fatty acids, among other nutrients, with 
      proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 up to 48 h. 
      Autophagy markers p62/SQSTM1 (p62) and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 
      1A/1B-light chain 3) were analyzed by Western blotting. Fluorescence microscopy with 
      mCherry-GFP-LC3 plasmid was applied to study the autophagy flux, and cytoprotective 
      effects were investigated with colorimetric MTT and LDH assays. Resvega induced 
      autophagy by showing increased autolysosome formation and autophagy flux, and the 
      change in the p62 and LC3 protein levels further confirmed the fluorescent 
      microscopy results. Moreover, Resvega provided a clear cytoprotection under 
      proteasome inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of the nutraceuticals 
      containing resveratrol, omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients in the prevention of 
      ARPE-19 cell damage.

AB  - Low levels of nutrient intake are common in industrialized countries. This has 
      negative implications on health and is associated with chronic diseases. 
      Supplementation of vitamins, minerals, and key nutrients to optimal levels may, 
      therefore, be beneficial for individual health and for the health economy. Although 
      the use of supplements has become very common, due to a lack of monitoring, there is 
      very limited data on the efficacy of supplementation with different formulas. In 
      this study, we present the results of a randomized controlled study on the efficacy 
      of a novel formulated nutraceutical, N247, in 250 healthy volunteers aged 26-75 
      years and a placebo control group (n = 35). The broad-spectrum formulation of N247 
      includes essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that are adequately 
      balanced in regard to synergies and related metabolic functions. Moreover, 
      tolerance, safety, and nutrient availability is an important aspect of daily, 
      long-term use of N247. After 3 months of regular N247 use, levels of vitamins and 
      minerals in serum were significantly increased in the N247 group compared with the 
      control group and a placebo group, with excellent compliance rates. Coupled with 
      additional natural ingredients that aim to increase the potency of the nutrients, 
      N247 may represent a novel and beneficial supplement for individuals with 
      nutritional deficiencies. Clinical Trial Registration:https://clinicaltrials.gov/,
