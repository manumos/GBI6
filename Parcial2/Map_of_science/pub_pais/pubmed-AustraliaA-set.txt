TI  - A Paradoxical Vasodilatory Nutraceutical Intervention for Prevention and Attenuation 
      of Migraine-A Hypothetical Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu12082487 [doi]
LID - 2487
AB  - Studies suggest that migraine pain has a vascular component. The prevailing dogma is 
      that peripheral vasoconstriction activates baroreceptors in central, large arteries. 
      Dilatation of central vessels stimulates nociceptors and induces cortical spreading 
      depression. Studies investigating nitric oxide (NO) donors support the indicated 
      hypothesis that pain is amplified when acutely administered. In this review, we 
      provide an alternate hypothesis which, if substantiated, may provide therapeutic 
      opportunities for attenuating migraine frequency and severity. We suggest that in 
      migraines, heightened sympathetic tone results in progressive central microvascular 
      constriction. Suboptimal parenchymal blood flow, we suggest, activates nociceptors 
      and triggers headache pain onset. Administration of NO donors could paradoxically 
      promote constriction of the microvasculature as a consequence of larger upstream 
      central artery vasodilatation. Inhibitors of NO production are reported to alleviate 
      migraine pain. We describe how constriction of larger upstream arteries, induced by 
      NO synthesis inhibitors, may result in a compensatory dilatory response of the 
      microvasculature. The restoration of central capillary blood flow may be the primary 
      mechanism for pain relief. Attenuating the propensity for central capillary 
      constriction and promoting a more dilatory phenotype may reduce frequency and 
      severity of migraines. Here, we propose consideration of two dietary nutraceuticals 
      for reducing migraine risk: L-arginine and aged garlic extracts.

TI  - Nanoliposomes and Tocosomes as Multifunctional Nanocarriers for the Encapsulation of 
      Nutraceutical and Dietary Molecules.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25030638 [doi]
LID - 638
AB  - Nanoscale lipid bilayers, or nanoliposomes, are generally spherical vesicles formed 
      by the dispersion of phospholipid molecules in a water-based medium by energy input. 
      The other nanoscale object discussed in this entry, i.e., tocosome, is a recently 
      introduced bioactive carrier made mainly from tocopheryl phosphates. Due to their 
      bi-compartmental structure, which consists of lipidic and aqueous compartments, 
      these nanocarriers are capable of carrying hydrophilic and hydrophobic material 
      separately or simultaneously. Nanoliposomes and tocosomes are able to provide 
      protection and release of sensitive food-grade bioactive materials in a sustained 
      manner. They are being utilized for the encapsulation of different types of 
      bioactive materials (such as drugs, vaccines, antimicrobials, antioxidants, minerals 
      and preservatives), for the enrichment and fortification of different food and 
      nutraceutical formulations and manufacturing of functional products. However, a 
      number of issues unique to the nutraceutical and food industry must first be 
      resolved before these applications can completely become a reality. Considering the 
      potentials and promises of these colloidal carrier systems, the present article 
      reviews various aspects of nanoliposomes, in comparison with tocosomes, including 
      the ingredients used in their manufacture, formation mechanisms and issues 
      pertaining to their application in the formulation of health promoting dietary 
      supplements and functional food products.

TI  - Nutrient and genetic biomarkers of nutraceutical treatment response in mood and 
      psychotic disorders: a systematic review.
PG  - 279-295
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2019.1625222 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Nutrient and genetic biomarkers in nutraceutical trials may allow for the 
      personalisation of nutraceutical treatment and assist in predicting treatment 
      response. We aimed to synthesise the findings of trials which have included these 
      biomarkers to determine which may be most useful for predicting nutraceutical 
      response in mood and psychotic disorders.Methods: A systematic review was conducted 
      assessing available literature concerning nutraceutical clinical trials in mood and 
      psychotic disorders (major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) with 
      baseline and endpoint blood nutrient markers or genetic data available.Results: We 
      identified 35 eligible studies (total n = 3836 participants) examining baseline and 
      endpoint nutrient biomarkers and/or genetic polymorphisms. The key result, as 
      reported in 10 out of 11 omega-3 studies, was a strong association between 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations (mostly EPA and DHA) and psychiatric 
      outcomes, although the exact nature of the association varied between studies and 
      diagnoses. There was no consistent evidence for levels of other nutrients (including 
      Vitamin D, SAM/SAH ratios, carnitine, folate and vitamin B12) relating to treatment 
      response. The evidence for associations between one-carbon cycle genotypes (e.g. 
      MTHFR C677 T, MTR and FOLH1) and treatment response was also 
      inconsistent.Discussion: The available data tentatively supports omega-3 indices as 
      biomarkers of response to omega-3 treatments in mood disorders. Further research 
      with larger samples examining combinations of polymorphisms is required to determine 
      if any genetic factors influence nutraceutical response in mood and psychotic 
      disorders.

AB  - Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn. (Cucurbitaceae) is an annual climbing plant, native 
      to Asia with multiple therapeutic uses in traditional medicine. This updated review 
      is aimed at discussing the ethnopharmacological, phytochemical, pharmacological 
      properties, and molecular mechanisms highlighted in preclinical experimental studies 
      and toxicological safety to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this genus. The 
      literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, Springer, Science Direct, and 
      database was analyzed using the basic keyword "Benincasa hispida." Other searching 
      strategies, including online resources, books, and journals, were used. The taxonomy 
      of the plant has been made by consulting "The Plant List". The results showed that 
      B. hispida has been used in traditional medicine to treat neurological diseases, 
      kidney disease, fever, and cough accompanied by thick mucus and to fight intestinal 
      worms. The main bioactive compounds contained in Benincasa hispida have cytotoxic, 
      anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Further safety and efficacy 
      investigations are needed to confirm these beneficial therapeutic effects and also 
      future human clinical studies.

AB  - The global demand for dietary proteins and protein-derived products are projected to 
      dramatically increase which cannot be met using traditional protein sources. Seafood 
      processing by-products (SPBs) and microalgae are promising resources that can fill 
      the demand gap for proteins and protein derivatives. Globally, 32 million tonnes of 
      SPBs are estimated to be produced annually which represents an inexpensive resource 
      for protein recovery while technical advantages in microalgal biomass production 
      would yield secure protein supplies with minimal competition for arable land and 
      freshwater resources. Moreover, these biomaterials are a rich source of proteins 
      with high nutritional quality while protein hydrolysates and biopeptides derived 
      from these marine proteins possess several useful bioactivities for commercial 
      applications in multiple industries. Efficient utilisation of these marine 
      biomaterials for protein recovery would not only supplement global demand and save 
      natural bioresources but would also successfully address the financial and 
      environmental burdens of biowaste, paving the way for greener production and a 
      circular economy. This comprehensive review analyses the potential of using SPBs and 
      microalgae for protein recovery and production critically assessing the feasibility 
      of current and emerging technologies used for the process development. Nutritional 
      quality, functionalities, and bioactivities of the extracted proteins and derived 
      products together with their potential applications for commercial product 
      development are also systematically summarised and discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a 
      debilitating illness, characterised by persistent fatigue that is unrelieved by 
      rest, in combination with a range of other disabling symptoms. There is no 
      diagnostic test nor targeted treatment available for this illness. The 
      pathomechanism also remains unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been considered 
      a possible underlying pathology based on reported differences including structural 
      and functional changes in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls. Due to the 
      potential role that mitochondria may play in ME/CFS, mitochondrial-targeting 
      nutraceutical interventions have been used to potentially assist in improving 
      patient outcomes such as fatigue. The aim of this systematic review is to appraise 
      literature assessing these nutraceuticals as a possible intervention for treating 
      ME/CFS. METHODS: A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, Medline (EBSCO host) and Web 
      of Science (via Clarivate Analytics) for journal articles published between January 
      1995 and 10th November 2020 was conducted. Articles assessing nutraceutical 
      interventions and ME/CFS patient outcomes were retrieved. Using specific inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria, the list of articles was further refined. Quality was 
      measured using the Rosendal scale. RESULTS: Nine intervention studies were included 
      in this review. The studies investigated patient symptom severity changes such as 
      altered fatigue levels in response to mitochondrial-targeting nutraceuticals. 
      Improvements in fatigue levels were observed in six of the nine studies. Secondary 
      outcomes assessed include biochemical, psychological, and quality of life 
      parameters. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of 
      mitochondria- targeting nutraceuticals in ME/CFS patients. Future well-designed 
      studies are required to elucidate both the involvement of mitochondria in the 
      pathomechanism of ME/CFS and the effect of mitochondrial-modifying agents on illness 
      severity.

AB  - Lipids are essential in maintaining brain function, and lipid profiles have been 
      reported to be altered in aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains as compared to 
      healthy mature brains. Both age and AD share common metabolic hallmarks such as 
      increased oxidative stress and perturbed metabolic function, and age remains the 
      most strongly correlated risk factor for AD, a neurodegenerative disease. A major 
      accompanying pathological symptom of these conditions is cognitive impairment, which 
      is linked with changes in lipid metabolism. Thus, nutraceuticals that affect brain 
      lipid metabolism or lipid levels as a whole have the potential to ameliorate 
      cognitive decline. Lipid analyses and lipidomic studies reveal changes in specific 
      lipid types with aging and AD, which can identify potential lipid-based 
      nutraceuticals to restore the brain to a healthy lipid phenotype. The brain lipid 
      profile can be influenced directly with dietary administration of lipids themselves, 
      although because of synergistic effects of nutrients it may be more useful to 
      consider a multi-component diet rather than single nutrient supplementation. Gut 
      microbiota also serve as a source of beneficial lipids, and the value of treatments 
      that manipulate the composition of gut microbiome should not be ignored. Lastly, 
      instead of direct supplementation, compounds that affect pathways involved with 
      lipid metabolism should also be considered as a way of manipulating lipid levels to 
      improve cognition. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of lipids in the 
      brain, the changing lipid profile in AD, current research on lipid-based 
      nutraceuticals and their therapeutic potential to combat cognitive impairment.

AB  - Phenylpropanoids are a diverse chemical class with immense health benefits that are 
      biosynthesized from the aromatic amino acid L-phenylalanine. This article reviews 
      the progress for accessing variation in phenylpropanoids in germplasm collections, 
      the genetic and molecular basis of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and the development 
      of cultivars dense in seed-phenylpropanoids. Progress is also reviewed on 
      high-throughput assays, factors that influence phenylpropanoids, the site of 
      phenylpropanoids accumulation in seed, Genotype × Environment interactions, and on 
      consumer attitudes for the acceptance of staple foods rich in phenylpropanoids. A 
      paradigm shift was noted in barley, maize, rice, sorghum, soybean, and wheat, 
      wherein cultivars rich in phenylpropanoids are grown in Europe and North and Central 
      America. Studies have highlighted some biological constraints that need to be 
      addressed for development of high-yielding cultivars that are rich in 
      phenylpropanoids. Genomics-assisted breeding is expected to facilitate rapid 
      introgression into improved genetic backgrounds by minimizing linkage drag. More 
      research is needed to systematically characterize germplasm pools for assessing 
      variation to support crop genetic enhancement, and assess consumer attitudes to 
      foods rich in phenylpropanoids.

TI  - EPA and DHA as markers of nutraceutical treatment response in major depressive 
      disorder.
PG  - 2439-2447
LID - 10.1007/s00394-019-02090-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression clinical trials are increasingly studying biomarkers to predict 
      and monitor response to treatment. Assessment of biomarkers may reveal subsets of 
      patients who are responsive to nutraceutical treatment, which may facilitate a 
      personalized approach to treating depression. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis 
      of an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (n = 158) investigating a 
      combination nutraceutical comprising Omega-3 (EPA 1 g/DHA 656 mg), SAMe, zinc, 
      5-HTP, folinic acid, and co-factors versus placebo for the treatment of Major 
      Depressive Disorder. The study explored levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
      folate, vitamin B12, zinc, homocysteine, and BDNF as possible predictors and 
      correlates of response to nutraceutical supplementation. RESULTS: Concentrations of 
      EPA and DHA in red cell membranes increased in response to treatment and were 
      significantly correlated with a decrease in depressive symptoms during active 
      treatment (p = 0.003 and p = 0.029; respectively). Higher baseline levels of omega-6 
      fatty acid also correlated with depression reduction in the active treatment group 
      ( p = 0.011). No other biomarkers were associated with a lessening of depressive 
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: Changes in fatty acid levels resulting from a nutraceutical 
      combination containing EPA and DHA provide a response biomarker in treating 
      depression.

AB  - A growing awareness of the mechanisms by which phytochemicals can influence upstream 
      endogenous cellular defence processes has led to intensified research into their 
      potential relevance in the prevention and treatment of disease. Pharmaceutical 
      medicine has historically looked to plants as sources of the starting materials for 
      drug development; however, the focus of nutraceutical medicine is to retain the 
      plant bioactive in as close to its native state as possible. As a consequence, the 
      potency of a nutraceutical concentrate or an extract may be lower than required for 
      significant gene expression. The molecular structure of bioactive phytochemicals to 
      a large extent determines the molecule's bioavailability. Polyphenols are abundant 
      in dietary phytochemicals, and extensive in vitro research has established many of 
      the signalling mechanisms involved in favourably modulating human biochemical 
      pathways. Such pathways are associated with core processes such as redox modulation 
      and immune modulation for infection control and for downregulating the synthesis of 
      inflammatory cytokines. Although the relationship between oxidative stress and 
      chronic disease continues to be affirmed, direct-acting antioxidants such as 
      vitamins A, C, and E, beta-carotene, and others have not yielded the expected 
      preventive or therapeutic responses, even though several large meta-analyses have 
      sought to evaluate the potential benefit of such supplements. Because polyphenols 
      exhibit poor bioavailability, few of their impressive in vitro findings have been 
      replicated in vivo. SFN, an aliphatic isothiocyanate, emerges as a phytochemical 
      with comparatively high bioavailability. A number of clinical trials have 
      demonstrated its ability to produce favourable outcomes in conditions for which 
      there are few satisfactory pharmaceutical solutions, foreshadowing the potential for 
      SFN as a clinically relevant nutraceutical. Although myrosinase-inert broccoli 
      sprout extracts are widely available, there now exist myrosinase-active broccoli 
      sprout supplements that yield sufficient SFN to match the doses used in clinical 
      trials.

AB  - Dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are associated with an increased risk of ischemic 
      cardiovascular disease. Positive effects of a nutraceutical combination comprising 
      red yeast rice, berberine, policosanol, astaxanthin, coenzyme Q10 and folic acid 
      (NComb) on plasma lipid and glucose levels have been reported in some but not all 
      clinical trials. To address this inconsistency, we tried to estimate the size of 
      lipid- and glucose-lowering effects of NComb through a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. A systematic literature search in 
      PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify 
      randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of NComb on plasma lipids and 
      glucose levels. Inverse variance-weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in lipid and glucose levels using a 
      random-effects model. Random-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the 
      effect of putative confounders on plasma lipid and glucose levels. Fourteen trials 
      (1670 subjects in the NComb arm and 1489 subjects in the control arm) met the 
      eligibility criteria for lipid analysis and 10 trials (1014 subjects in the NComb 
      arm and 962 subjects in the control arm) for glucose analysis. Overall, WMDs were 
      significant for the impact of NComb supplementation on plasma levels of total 
      cholesterol (-26.15mg/dL, p<0.001), LDL-cholesterol (-23.85mg/dL, p<0.001), 
      HDL-cholesterol (2.53mg/dL, p<0.001), triglycerides (-13.83mg/dL, p<0.001) and 
      glucose (-2.59mg/dL, p=0.010). NComb-induced amelioration of lipid profile was not 
      affected by duration of supplementation nor by baseline lipid levels; conversely, a 
      greater glucose-lowering effect of NComb was found with higher baseline glucose 
      levels and longer durations of supplementation. In conclusion, the present results 
      suggest that NComb supplementation is associated with improvement of lipid and 
      glucose profile. Short-term beneficial effects of NComb supplementation appear to be 
      maintained in the long term.

TI  - The effect of emerging nutraceutical interventions for clinical and biological 
      outcomes in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the considerable burden of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related 
      symptoms and the need to identify effective interventions to prevent disease 
      progression, various nutraceutical interventions have been trialed as adjunctive 
      treatments. The aim of this review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
      nutraceutical interventions for clinical and biological outcomes in people with MS. 
      METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA reporting guidelines, a systematic literature 
      search was conducted using three electronic literature databases. Risk of bias was 
      assessed using the Jadad scale. RESULTS: Thirty-seven randomized controlled trials, 
      investigating fourteen nutraceuticals, were included in the review. Trials that 
      investigated alpha lipoic acid (n = 4/6), ginkgo biloba (n = 3/5), vitamin A 
      (n = 2/2), biotin (n = 1/2), carnitine (n = 1/2), green tea (n = 1/2), coenzyme Q10 
      (n = 1/1), probiotics (n = 1/1), curcumin (n = 1/1), Andrographis paniculata 
      (n = 1/1), ginseng (n = 1/1), and lemon verbena (n = 1/1) were reported to improve 
      biological (e.g. MRI brain volume change, antioxidant capacity) and/or clinical 
      (e.g. fatigue, depression, Expanded Disability Status Scale) outcomes in multiple 
      sclerosis compared to control. However, most trials were relatively small (average 
      study sample size across included studies, n = 55) and there were few replicate 
      studies per nutraceutical to validate the reported results. Furthermore, some 
      nutraceuticals (e.g. green tea and inosine) should be used with caution due to 
      reported adverse events. Risk of bias across most studies was low, with 31 studies 
      receiving a score between 4 and 5 (out of 5) on the Jadad Scale. CONCLUSION: The 
      existing literature provides preliminary support for the use of a number of 
      nutraceutical interventions in MS. However, sufficiently powered long-term trials 
      are required to expand the currently limited literature and to investigate 
      unexplored nutraceuticals that may target relevant pathways involved in MS such as 
      the gut microbiome and mitochondrial dysfunction. Prospero ID: CRD42018111736.

TI  - Quantitation of anthocyanins in elderberry fruit extracts and nutraceutical 
      formulations with paper spray ionization mass spectrometry.
PG  - 58-64

AB  - The ability to rapidly identify and quantitate, over a wide range of concentrations, 
      anthocyanins in food and therapeutic products is important to ensuring their 
      presence at medicinally significant levels. Sensitive, yet mild, analysis conditions 
      are required given their susceptibility to degradation and transformation. Paper 
      spray ionization has been used to detect and quantify the levels of anthocyanin 
      levels in extracts of fresh and dried elderberries, and elderberry stems, as well as 
      3 commercially available nutraceutical formulations. The component cyanidin 
      glucosides, including cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
      cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside, and the aglycone 
      cyanidin, were readily detected in a range of sources. Quantitation was achieved by 
      establishing a calibration plot from dilutions of a stock solution of 
      cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside containing malvidin-3,5-diglucoside as an internal standard 
      at a fixed concentration. The same standard was used to quantify the anthocyanin 
      content in the fruit and nutraceutical formulations. Wide 5-fold variations in 
      anthocyanin concentration were detected in the nutraceutical formulations from 
      different suppliers ranging from 1050 to 5430 mg/100 g. These concentrations 
      compared with 500 to 2370 mg/100 g measured in the dried stems and fruit, 
      respectively.

AB  - This study aims to provide information on physicochemical properties of Arenga 
      pinnata endosperm (APE) and its antidiabetic activity for utilization in the food 
      and pharmaceutical industries. The antidiabetic effect of APE was studied through an 
      observational experiment on the blood glucose level of rats. The physicochemical 
      properties of APE were determined using a texturometer, X-ray powder diffraction, 
      Brookfield viscometer, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared 
      spectroscopy, and light microscope. The APE was categorized based on its texture 
      into three groups. The crystal structure of APE is microspore and amorf while the 
      hydrogel has a non-Newtonian property and is stable at 50°C. The viscosity index was 
      increased in the increasing temperature with the order of high viscosity of APE 
      being 1, 2, and 3. The hydrogel shape of APE 1 and 3 was lameral in the 
      concentration of 1.25%. For antidiabetic study, the findings demonstrated that the 
      APE could reduce the blood glucose level. The APE powders 1 and 2 with the 
      respective weight of 50 and 200 mg have significant effects on reducing rat blood 
      glucose level compared to the diabetic rats. Based on these properties, APE could 
      potentially be used as a natural antidiabetic food without having any side effect 
      and in the pharmaceutical industry for some purposes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate changes in inflammatory and 
      oxidative stress levels following treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 
      mitochondrial-enhancing agents (CT), and to assess the how these changes may predict 
      and/or moderate clinical outcomes primarily the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating 
      Scale (MADRS). METHODS: This study involved secondary analysis of a 
      placebo-controlled randomised trial (n = 163). Serum samples were collected at 
      baseline and week 16 of the clinical trial to determine changes in Interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) following adjunctive CT and/or NAC 
      treatment, and to explore the predictability of the outcome or moderator effects of 
      these markers. RESULTS: In the NAC-treated group, no difference was observed in 
      serum IL-6 and TAC levels after 16 weeks of treatment with NAC or CT. However, 
      results from a moderator analysis showed that in the CT group, lower IL-6 levels at 
      baseline was a significant moderator of MADRS χ2 (df) = 4.90, p = 0.027) and 
      Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I, χ2 (df) = 6.28 p = 0.012). In 
      addition, IL-6 was a non-specific but significant predictor of functioning (based on 
      the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)), indicating that 
      individuals with higher IL-6 levels at baseline had a greater improvement on SOFAS 
      regardless of their treatment (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Participants with lower IL-6 
      levels at baseline had a better response to the adjunctive treatment with the 
      mitochondrial-enhancing agents in terms of improvements in MADRS and CGI-I outcomes.

TI  - Effect of long-term nutraceutical and dietary supplement use on cognition in the 
      elderly: a 10-year systematic review of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 280-298
LID - 10.1017/S0007114517003452 [doi]
AB  - Nutraceuticals have generated interest as a way to mitigate the cognitive decline in 
      older adults. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the evidence for 
      these claims from the scientific literature in randomised, double-blinded, 
      controlled trials (duration: ≥1 year; participants: n≥100; age(mean): ≥65 years). 
      Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL 
      and Web of Science) and identified twenty-five studies published between the 
      15·June·2006 and 14·June·2016. Interventions included B-vitamins, n-3 fatty acids, 
      antioxidant vitamins and herbs. Of the B-vitamin studies, four found benefits to 
      cognition with supplementation. The first of these B-vitamin studies, in individuals 
      with mild cognitive impairment (n 266; duration=2 years), included benefit to 
      executive function (P=0·015) and improvements in the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE) among participants with baseline homocysteine above 11·3 µmol/l (P<0·001). In 
      the same sample, the second study found cognitive benefits of B-vitamins dependent 
      on the higher baseline plasma n-3 fatty acid status. The third B-vitamin study (n 
      900; duration=2 years) reported improved performance in immediate (P=0·046) and 
      delayed recall (P=0·013), whereas the fourth study (n 856; duration=2 years) 
      reported slower rate of cognitive decline in the MMSE (P=0·05). One study 
      investigating DHA treatment (n 402; duration=1·5 years) revealed the slower rate of 
      cognitive change in apoE e4 non-carriers (P=0·03). As only five included studies 
      revealed notable benefits, presently based on the specific compounds explored here, 
      there is not compelling evidence to support the use nutraceuticals to improve 
      cognition in the elderly. Future long-term trials of nutraceuticals should 
      investigate interactions with lifestyle, blood biomarkers and genetic risk factors.

      induced disturbances in blood-brain barrier function in wild-type mice.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1742-2094-10-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that disturbances in the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB) may be pivotal to the pathogenesis and pathology of vascular-based 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Studies suggest that heightened systemic and central 
      inflammations are associated with BBB dysfunction. This study investigated the 
      effect of the anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals garlic extract-aged (GEA), alpha 
      lipoic acid (ALA), niacin, and nicotinamide (NA) in a murine dietary-induced model 
      of BBB dysfunction. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet enriched in saturated 
      fatty acids (SFA, 40% fat of total energy) for nine months to induce systemic 
      inflammation and BBB disturbances. Nutraceutical treatment groups included the 
      provision of either GEA, ALA, niacin or NA in the positive control SFA-group and in 
      low-fat fed controls. Brain parenchymal extravasation of plasma derived 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) and large macromolecules (apolipoprotein (apo) B 
      lipoproteins) measured by quantitative immunofluorescent microscopy, were used as 
      markers of disturbed BBB integrity. Parenchymal glial fibrillar acidic protein 
      (GFAP) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were considered in the context of surrogate 
      markers of neurovascular inflammation and oxidative stress. Total anti-oxidant 
      status and glutathione reductase activity were determined in plasma. RESULTS: Brain 
      parenchymal abundance of IgG and apoB lipoproteins was markedly exaggerated in mice 
      maintained on the SFA diet concomitant with significantly increased GFAP and COX-2, 
      and reduced systemic anti-oxidative status. The nutraceutical GEA, ALA, niacin, and 
      NA completely prevented the SFA-induced disturbances of BBB and normalized the 
      measures of neurovascular inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      anti-inflammatory nutraceutical agents GEA, ALA, niacin, or NA are potent inhibitors 
      of dietary fat-induced disturbances of BBB induced by systemic inflammations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lowbush blueberry extract (Vaccinium angustifolium) is abundant with 
      polyphenols (such as chlorogenic acid) with high antioxidant profile. It has 
      received great interest due to its protective role in many disorders such as heart 
      diseases and neurological disorders. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that blueberry leaf 
      extract might have a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing 
      oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. METHOD: Blueberry leaf nutraceutical 
      extract was administered orally to male albino rats at three different doses (25, 50 
      and 100 mg/kg/day of the extract, equivalent to 3.4, 6.8 and 13.6 mg of chlorogenic 
      acid, respectively) once daily for 28 consecutive days against a dose of 
      isoprenaline (ISO) (5 mg/kg) for 14 days. RESULTS: The results indicated that 
      isoprenaline induced significant myocardial damage, characterized by conduction 
      abnormalities, increased heart-to-body weight ratio, increased serum CKMB, AST, 
      c-TnI and LDH. Pretreatment with blueberry extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day 
      (equivalent to 6.8 mg chlorogenic acid) protected against ISO-induced ECG changes, 
      leakage of cardiac enzymes and histopathological changes. Also, ISO caused 
      significant glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and reduction in activities of 
      antioxidant catalase enzyme. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with 
      blueberry extract. Additionally, ISO elicited inflammatory effects by increasing the 
      expression of NF-κB, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 while pretreatment with blueberry extract 
      significantly inhibited these inflammatory responses. Furthermore, ISO induced 
      fibrosis by increasing the level of TGF-β while pretreatment with blueberry extract 
      significantly reduced it. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that blueberry leaf 
      extract possessed a potent protective effect against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy 
      via suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis.

TI  - Use of a male antioxidant nutraceutical is associated with superior live birth rates 
      during IVF treatment.

AB  - Oxidative stress is prevalent among infertile men and is a significant cause of 
      sperm DNA damage. Since sperm DNA damage may reduce embryo quality and increase 
      miscarriage rates, it is possible that untreated sperm oxidative stress may impair 
      in vitro fertilization (IVF) live birth rates. Given that the antioxidant Menevit is 
      reported to reduce sperm DNA damage, it was hypothesized that men's consumption of 
      this supplement may alter IVF outcomes. Therefore, a retrospective cohort study was 
      conducted analyzing outcomes for couples undergoing their first fresh embryo 
      transfer. Men were classified as controls if they were taking no supplements, health 
      conscious controls if taking "general health" supplements, or Menevit users. Men 
      with karyotype abnormalities, or cycles using donated, frozen and surgically 
      extracted sperm were excluded. Among the final study cohort of 657 men, live birth 
      rates were significantly higher in Menevit users than controls (multivariate 
      adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.45, P= 0.046), 
      but not between controls taking no supplements and those using general health 
      supplements, thereby suggesting that potential health conscious behavior in 
      supplement users is unlikely responsible for the superior outcomes in Menevit users. 
      Interestingly, in a post hoc sensitivity analysis, live birth rates among Menevit 
      users were statistically superior to controls for lean men (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 
      1.18-6.28; P= 0.019), not their overweight/obese counterparts (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 
      0.75-2.22, P = 0.37). The results of this large cohort study therefore support a 
      positive association between men's use of the Menevit antioxidant during IVF 
      treatment and live birth rates, especially in lean individuals.

TI  - Physical Activity as a Predictor of Clinical Trial Outcomes in Bipolar Depression: A 
      Subanalysis of a Mitochondrial-Enhancing Nutraceutical Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 306-318
LID - 10.1177/0706743719889547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) generally engage in low levels of 
      physical activity (PA), and yet few studies have investigated the relationship 
      between PA and change in BD symptom severity. The aim of this subanalysis of an 
      adjunctive nutraceutical randomized controlled trial for the treatment of bipolar 
      depression was to explore the relationship between PA, the active adjunctive 
      treatments (a nutraceutical "mitochondrial cocktail"), and clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: Participants with bipolar depression were randomized to receive 
      N-acetylcysteine alone, N-acetylcysteine with a combination of nutraceuticals 
      (chosen for the potential to increase mitochondrial activity), or placebo for 16 
      weeks. Participants (n = 145) who completed the International Physical Activity 
      Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF; measured at Week 4) were included in this 
      exploratory subanalysis. Assessments of BD symptoms, functioning, and quality of 
      life were completed at monthly visits up until Week 20. Generalised Estimating 
      Equations were used to explore whether IPAQ-SF scores were a moderator of treatment 
      received on outcomes of the study. RESULTS: Week-4 PA was not related to changes in 
      Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores across the study until Week 20. 
      However, participants who engaged in more PA and who received the combination 
      treatment were more likely to have a reduction in scores on the Bipolar Depression 
      Rating Scale (P = 0.03). However, this was not consistent in all domains explored 
      using the IPAQ-SF. Participants who engaged in higher levels of PA also experienced 
      greater improvement in social and occupational functioning and less impairment in 
      functioning due to their psychopathology and improvement in quality of life at Week 
      20, irrespective of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence of 
      the association between PA and reduction in BD symptoms in a nutraceutical clinical 
      trial. However, further research assessing the potential synergistic effects of PA 
      in BD is required.

TI  - Evaluation of androgenic activity of nutraceutical-derived steroids using mammalian 
      and yeast in vitro androgen bioassays.
PG  - 2065-74
LID - 10.1021/ac102845y [doi]
AB  - Androgenic steroids marketed online as nutraceuticals are a growing concern in sport 
      doping. The inability of conventional mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques to 
      detect structurally novel androgens has led to the development of in vitro androgen 
      bioassays to identify such designer androgens by their bioactivity. The objective of 
      this study was to determine the androgenic bioactivity of novel steroidal compounds 
      isolated from nutraceuticals using both yeast and mammalian cell-based androgen 
      bioassays. We developed two new in vitro androgen bioassays by stably transfecting 
      HEK293 and HuH7 cells with the human androgen receptor (hAR) expression plasmid 
      together with a novel reporter gene vector (enhancer/ARE/SEAP). The yeast 
      β-galactosidase androgen bioassay was used for comparison. Our new bioassay 
      featuring the enhancer/ARE/SEAP construct (-S) displayed simpler assay format and 
      higher specificity with lower sensitivity compared with the commonly used mouse 
      mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-luciferase. The relative potencies (RP), defined as 
      [EC(50)] of testosterone/[EC(50)] of steroid, of nutraceutical extracts in the 
      yeast, HEK293-S, and HuH7-S, were 34, 333, and 80,000 for Hemapolin; 208, 250, and 
      80 for Furazadrol; 0.38, 10, and 106 for Oxyguno; 2.7, 0.28, and 15 for Trena; and 
      4.5, 0.1, and 0.4 for Formadrol, respectively. The wide discrepancies in rank RP of 
      these compounds was reconciled into a consistent potency ranking when the cells were 
      treated with meclofenamic acid, a nonselective inhibitor of steroid metabolizing 
      enzymes. These findings indicate that steroids extracted from nutraceuticals can be 
      converted in vitro into more or less potent androgens in mammalian but not in yeast 
      cells. We conclude that the putative androgenic bioactivity of a new compound may 
      depend on the bioassay cellular format and that mammalian cell bioassays may have an 
      added benefit in screening for proandrogens but sacrifice specificity for 
      sensitivity in quantitation.

TI  - A pilot study of 4CYTE™ Epiitalis® Forte, a novel nutraceutical, in the management 
      of naturally occurring osteoarthritis in dogs.

AB  - The primary goal of this pilot study was to assess, the efficacy of a new 
      nutraceutical, 4CYTE™ Epiitalis® Forte, containing, as a standalone, a proprietary 
      plant oil extract, Epiitalis, in dogs presenting with signs of osteoarthritis (OA). 
      Fifty dogs aged 9.2 (±3.2) years with signs of naturally occurring OA were included 
      in this report. They were free of other comorbidities and were not on any 
      medications except for those utilised for managing their OA. In these dogs, the 
      current treatments were continued to avoid any sudden changes in their disease 
      management. The effects of the 4CYTE Epiitalis Forte were assessed both at the 
      beginning and at the end of a 1 month-long treatment period. The evaluation 
      consisted of an objective lameness assessment (TPI%[total pressure index]) using a 
      gait analysis (GAITRite® Portable Walkway System) and a subjective quality-of-life 
      questionnaire, the Helsinki Chronic Pain Index (HCPI). Additional exploratory 
      objective measurements included the Symmetry Index (SI) and the fore/hind limb ratio 
      (T/P TPI%). Of dogs, 74% (34/46) registered a numerical improvement in TPI% in their 
      worse limb. In addition, of the 93.5% of the dogs that demonstrated improvement in 
      their HCPI scores by at least 5% on the quality-of-life questionnaire, 79% 
      demonstrated improvements in gait based on TPI%. Finally, there were improvements 
      measured in both exploratory objective endpoints SI and T/P TPI%. These encouraging 
      results will be used to develop a protocol for a follow-up placebo-controlled 
      randomised study to confirm the efficacy of this new nutraceutical for dogs 
      suffering from OA.
