TI  - Curcumin, a potent therapeutic nutraceutical and its enhanced delivery and 
      bioaccessibility by pickering emulsions.
PG  - 124-157
LID - 10.1007/s13346-021-00936-3 [doi]
AB  - Curcumin is a biomolecule with functional moieties, which contribute to its 
      anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. It has shown several 
      therapeutic effects on treating inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and 
      contributes to the reduction of oxidative stress and damage to body tissues. 
      However, its low solubility and fast metabolism limit its absorption in the 
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and lead to its low bioavailability. Preparation of 
      Pickering emulsions stabilized with mineral or biopolymer-based nanoparticles can be 
      an effective strategy for enhancing the stability of curcumin against degradation, 
      increasing its bioaccessibility in the GI tract, and achieving its controlled 
      release at various locations based on changes in environmental conditions. Various 
      nanoparticles prepared from minerals, proteins, and polysaccharides show potential 
      for stabilizing the curcumin-loaded emulsions, and their wettability can be altered 
      through complexation and formation of hybrid nanoparticles. Stabilization of 
      Pickering emulsions with polysaccharide-based nanoparticles and their complexes can 
      enhance the stability of the curcumin against degradation. Moreover, various 
      protein-based nanoparticles and their conjugated forms with other proteins or 
      polysaccharides can enable the preparation of high internal phase Pickering 
      emulsions (HIPEs) with concomitant higher loading and bioaccessibility of the 
      curcumin molecule. In light of the several therapeutic properties of curcumin, this 
      review article aims to highlight recent studies and the strategies used for the 
      preparation of curcumin Pickering emulsions stabilized by various nanoparticles for 
      enhancing its bioaccessibility during metabolism. These may be useful in 
      pharmaceutical and food industries for drug development and delivery and 
      fortification of food products with this nutraceutical component.

TI  - Nutritional and Nutraceutical Properties of Mexican Traditional Mole Sauce.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27030966 [doi]
LID - 966
AB  - Mole sauce is one of the traditional Mexican foods; it is a complex mixture of 
      ingredients of diverse origins that directly influence its nutritional value. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties and 
      nutritional components in five varieties of mole from Hidalgo in Mexico namely verde 
      (V), ranchero (R), almendrado (A), casero (C), and pipian (P). Proximal chemical 
      analysis and determination of the color index and the content of total starch, 
      dietary fiber, mineral content (Ca, Na, K, and Mg), total phenolic content, and 
      antioxidant activity by ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic 
      acid)) and DPPH (2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl) were carried out. All the five 
      varieties of mole reported less than 25% moisture content while fat content varied 
      from 42.9% to 58.25%. The color index ranged from a deep orange to a deep red color. 
      A fair percentage of dietary fiber was found in all mole varieties with a low amount 
      of starch as well. The presence of mostly insoluble dietary fiber, high phenolic 
      content (36.13-79.49 mg GAE/100 g), and high antioxidant activity could be 
      considered important strengths to boost the consumption of these traditional 
      preparations. This research will contribute to a better scientific knowledge of 
      traditional Mexican sauces as functional foods or nutraceuticals that could be used 
      to avoid health disorders.

TI  - Cellulosic Nanomaterials in Food and Nutraceutical Applications: A Review.
PG  - 8-19
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04204 [doi]
AB  - Cellulosic nanomaterials (CNMs) are organic, green nanomaterials that are obtained 
      from renewable sources and possess exceptional mechanical strength and 
      biocompatibility. The associated unique physical and chemical properties have made 
      these nanomaterials an intriguing prospect for various applications including the 
      food and nutraceutical industry. From the immobilization of various bioactive agents 
      and enzymes, emulsion stabilization, direct food additives, to the development of 
      intelligent packaging systems or pathogen or pH detectors, the potential food 
      related applications for CNMs are endless. Over the past decade, there have been 
      several reviews published covering different aspects of cellulosic nanomaterials, 
      such as processing-structure-property relationship, physical and chemical 
      properties, rheology, extraction, nanocomposites, etc. In this critical review, we 
      have discussed and provided a summary of the recent developments in the utilization 
      of cellulosic nanomaterials in applications related to food and nutraceuticals.

TI  - Diet and nutraceutical interventions for headache management: A review of the 
      evidence.
PG  - 1112-1133
LID - 10.1177/0333102415590239 [doi]
AB  - Background The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) is common among 
      patients with primary headaches. In parallel, CAM research is growing. Diet 
      interventions comprise another category of non-pharmacologic treatment for primary 
      headache that is of increasing clinical and research interest. Methods A literature 
      search was carried out to identify studies on the efficacy of diet and nutraceutical 
      interviews for primary headache in the pediatric and adult populations. MEDLINE, 
      Embase and EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched 
      to identify studies. Results There is a growing body of literature on the potential 
      use of CAM and diet interventions for primary headache disorders. This review 
      identified literature on the use of a variety of diet and nutraceutical 
      interventions for headache. Most of the studies assessed the efficacy of these 
      interventions for migraine, though some explored their role in tension-type headache 
      and cluster headache. The quality of the evidence in this area is generally poor. 
      Conclusions CAM is becoming more commonplace in the headache world. Several 
      interventions show promise, but caution needs to be exercised in using these agents 
      given limited safety and efficacy data. In addition, interest in exploring diet 
      interventions in the treatment of primary headaches is emerging. Further research 
      into the efficacy of nutraceutical and diet interventions is warranted.

LID - 10.3390/molecules26134023 [doi]
LID - 4023
AB  - Zanthoxylum species (Syn. Fagara species) of the Rutaceae family are widely used in 
      many countries as food and in trado-medicinal practice due to their wide 
      geographical distribution and medicinal properties. Peer reviewed journal articles 
      and ethnobotanical records that reported the traditional knowledge, 
      phytoconstituents, biological activities and toxicological profiles of Z. species 
      with a focus on metabolic and neuronal health were reviewed. It was observed that 
      many of the plant species are used as food ingredients and in treating inflammation, 
      pain, hypertension and brain diseases. Over 500 compounds have been isolated from Z. 
      species, and the biological activities of both the plant extracts and their 
      phytoconstituents, including their mechanisms of action, are discussed. The 
      phytochemicals responsible for the biological activities of some of the species are 
      yet to be identified. Similarly, biological activities of some isolated compounds 
      remain unknown. Taken together, the Z. species extracts and compounds possess 
      promising biological activities and should be further explored as potential sources 
      of new nutraceuticals and drugs.

TI  - Drug-Nutraceutical Co-Crystal and Salts for Making New and Improved Bi-Functional 
      Analgesics.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12121144 [doi]
LID - 1144
AB  - The discovery and development of effective analgesics is greatly lagging behind the 
      steadily rising prevalence of chronic pain. Currently prescribed analgesics for 
      chronic pain are lacking in efficacy mainly due to their narrowly-targeted mechanism 
      of action. Driving neuronal hyperexcitability that underlies symptoms of chronic 
      pain are multiple non-neuronal processes, among which are tissue hypoxia and 
      oxidative stress. Here we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and activity of new 
      multi-component bi-functional analgesic crystalline solids, co-crystals, and salts, 
      based on pairing of vasodilatory anti-hypoxic drugs pentoxifylline, clonidine and 
      linsidomine with antioxidant nutraceuticals protocatechuic acid, α-lipoic acid, and 
      caffeic acid. After validation, chemical and structural characterization of these 
      novel salts and co-crystals, topical formulations of the products were tested in a 
      rat model of complex regional pain syndrome. Analgesic effects achieved with the 
      salts and co-crystal exceeded the efficacy and/or potency of constituent compounds 
      indicating that more effective, advanced analgesics can readily be developed by 
      careful pairing of compounds that simultaneously target multiple neural and 
      non-neural processes driving chronic pain.

      applications of the peptide aggregates.

AB  - Plastein is a protease-induced peptide aggregate with prospective application in 
      enhancing the nutritional quality of proteins and debittering protein hydrolysates. 
      These properties are yet to be applied in product development possibly due to 
      economic considerations (production cost vs. product yields). This paper reviews 
      currently proposed mechanisms of plastein formation including condensation, 
      transpeptidation and physical interaction of aggregating peptides. Emerging findings 
      indicate that plastein possesses bioactivities, thereby expanding its prospective 
      application. The role of proteases in inducing peptide interaction in plastein 
      remains unclear. Understanding the protease function will facilitate the development 
      of efficient proteases and scalable industrial processes for plastein production.

      Food, Nutraceutical, and Pharmaceutical Sector.
LID - 10.3390/md18050274 [doi]
LID - 274
AB  - Sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) is the most abundant and widely distributed 
      species in the cold waters of North Atlantic Ocean. C. frondosa contains a wide 
      range of bioactive compounds, mainly collagen, cerebrosides, glycosaminoglycan, 
      chondroitin sulfate, saponins, phenols, and mucopolysaccharides, which demonstrate 
      unique biological and pharmacological properties. In particular, the body wall of 
      this marine invertebrate is the major edible part and contains most of the active 
      constituents, mainly polysaccharides and collagen, which exhibit numerous biological 
      activities, including anticancer, anti-hypertensive, anti-angiogenic, 
      anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-coagulation, antimicrobial, antioxidation, and 
      anti- osteoclastogenic properties. In particular, triterpene glycosides (frondoside 
      A and other) are the most researched group of compounds due to their potential 
      anticancer activity. This review summarizes the latest information on C. frondosa, 
      mainly geographical distribution, landings specific to Canadian coastlines, 
      processing, commercial products, trade market, bioactive compounds, and potential 
      health benefits in the context of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

TI  - Effect of Graft and Nano ZnO on Nutraceutical and Mineral Content in Bell Pepper.
LID - 10.3390/plants10122793 [doi]
LID - 2793
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of grafting, zinc oxide 
      nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), and their interaction on the nutritional composition of 
      bell pepper plants. The treatments evaluated included grafted and non-grafted pepper 
      plants with four concentrations of ZnO NPs (0, 10, 20, 30 mg L(-1)) applied to the 
      foliage. The following parameters were evaluated: content of N, P, K(+), Ca(2+), 
      Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Zn(2+), Fe(2+), Cu(2+), total antioxidants, ascorbic acid, total 
      phenols, glutathione, total proteins, fruit firmness, and total soluble solids. 
      Grafting increased the content of N 12.2%, P 15.9%, K(+) 26.7%, Mg(2+) 20.3%, Mn(2+) 
      34.7%, Zn(2+) 19.5%, Fe(2+) 18.2%, Cu(2+) 11.5%, antioxidant capacity 2.44%, 
      ascorbic acid 4.63%, total phenols 1.33%, glutathione 7.18%, total proteins 1.08%, 
      fruit firmness 8.8%. The application of 30 mg L(-1) ZnO NPs increased the content of 
      N 12.3%, P 25.9%, Mg(2+) 36.8%, Mn(2+) 42.2%, Zn(2+) 27%, Fe(2+) 45%, antioxidant 
      activity 13.95%, ascorbic acid 26.77%, total phenols 10.93%, glutathione 11.46%, 
      total proteins 11.01%, and fruit firmness 17.7% compared to the control. The results 
      obtained demonstrate the influence of the use of grafts and ZnO NPs as tools that 
      could improve the quality and nutrient content in fruits of bell pepper crops.

TI  - Comparison of Nutritional and Nutraceutical Properties of Burdock Roots Cultivated 
      in Fengxian and Peixian of China.
LID - 10.3390/foods10092095 [doi]
LID - 2095
AB  - This study aimed to analyze and compare the nutritional quality of powders of 
      burdock root from Fengxian (FX) and Peixian (PX) in China. The nutrient composition 
      including carbohydrates, protein, amino acids, vitamin C, carotenoids, as well as 
      total phenols, total flavonoids and phenolic compounds were investigated in addition 
      to in vitro antioxidant capacity. The results showed that the basic nutrients of 
      burdock root powder (BRP) in both locations did not have significant differences (p 
      > 0.05), although the in vitro antioxidant capacity of BRP of Fengxian (F-BRP) was 
      greater than that of PX (p < 0.05). The burdock root peel powder (BRPP) possessed 
      more phenolics and stronger in vitro antioxidant capacity than the burdock root 
      powder (BRP) and peeled burdock root powder (PBRP) (p < 0.05). Moreover, better 
      quality burdock root was obtained from FX. F-BRP was consequently analyzed by 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for its phenolic 
      composition. Seventeen phenolics, mainly caffeoylquinic acids, were detected. In 
      addition, a total of 181 volatile compounds belonging to eight types were detected 
      including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes, esters, acids, linear or aromatic 
      hydrocarbons, and others. The diverse compounds found in this study can provide a 
      theoretical basis for the development and utilization of burdock in the food 
      industry.

AB  - Phenylpropanoids are a diverse chemical class with immense health benefits that are 
      biosynthesized from the aromatic amino acid L-phenylalanine. This article reviews 
      the progress for accessing variation in phenylpropanoids in germplasm collections, 
      the genetic and molecular basis of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and the development 
      of cultivars dense in seed-phenylpropanoids. Progress is also reviewed on 
      high-throughput assays, factors that influence phenylpropanoids, the site of 
      phenylpropanoids accumulation in seed, Genotype × Environment interactions, and on 
      consumer attitudes for the acceptance of staple foods rich in phenylpropanoids. A 
      paradigm shift was noted in barley, maize, rice, sorghum, soybean, and wheat, 
      wherein cultivars rich in phenylpropanoids are grown in Europe and North and Central 
      America. Studies have highlighted some biological constraints that need to be 
      addressed for development of high-yielding cultivars that are rich in 
      phenylpropanoids. Genomics-assisted breeding is expected to facilitate rapid 
      introgression into improved genetic backgrounds by minimizing linkage drag. More 
      research is needed to systematically characterize germplasm pools for assessing 
      variation to support crop genetic enhancement, and assess consumer attitudes to 
      foods rich in phenylpropanoids.

      patients who are responsive to nutraceutical treatment, which may facilitate a 
      personalized approach to treating depression. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis 
      of an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (n = 158) investigating a 
      combination nutraceutical comprising Omega-3 (EPA 1 g/DHA 656 mg), SAMe, zinc, 
      5-HTP, folinic acid, and co-factors versus placebo for the treatment of Major 
      Depressive Disorder. The study explored levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
      folate, vitamin B12, zinc, homocysteine, and BDNF as possible predictors and 
      correlates of response to nutraceutical supplementation. RESULTS: Concentrations of 
      EPA and DHA in red cell membranes increased in response to treatment and were 
      significantly correlated with a decrease in depressive symptoms during active 
      treatment (p = 0.003 and p = 0.029; respectively). Higher baseline levels of omega-6 
      fatty acid also correlated with depression reduction in the active treatment group 
      ( p = 0.011). No other biomarkers were associated with a lessening of depressive 
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: Changes in fatty acid levels resulting from a nutraceutical 
      combination containing EPA and DHA provide a response biomarker in treating 
      depression.

TI  - Nutraceutical Targeting of Inflammation-Modulating microRNAs in Severe Forms of 
      COVID-19: A Novel Approach to Prevent the Cytokine Storm.
PG  - 602999

LID - 602999
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the number one health 
      problem worldwide. As of August 2020, it has affected more than 18 million humans 
      and caused over 700,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can 
      lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Under certain circumstances, the viral 
      infection leads to excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response, which is 
      associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary alveolar 
      structures. This phenomenon has been referred to as the "cytokine storm," and it is 
      closely linked to lung injury, acute respiratory syndrome and mortality. 
      Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available to prevent the infection, and 
      no effective treatment is available to reduce the mortality associated with the 
      severe form of the disease. The cytokine storm associate with COVID-19 shows 
      similarities with those observed in other pathologies such as sepsis, acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury and other viral infection including 
      severe cases of influenza. However, the specific mechanisms that cause and modulate 
      the cytokine storm in the different conditions remain to be determined. micro-RNAs 
      are important regulators of gene expression, including key inflammatory cytokines 
      involved in the massive recruitment of immune cells to the lungs such as IL1β, IL6, 
      and TNFα. In recent years, it has been shown that nutraceutical agents can modulate 
      the expression of miRs involved in the regulation of cytokines in various 
      inflammatory diseases. Here we review the potential role of 
      inflammatory-regulating-miRs in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and 
      propose that nutraceutical agents may represent a supportive therapeutic approach to 
      modulate dysregulated miRs in this condition, providing benefits in severe 
      respiratory diseases.

TI  - Antioxidant, Scavenging, Reducing, and Anti-Proliferative Activities of Selected 
      Tropical Brown Seaweeds Confirm the Nutraceutical Potential of Spatoglossum asperum.

AB  - Brown seaweeds have shown high potential of bioactivity and provide health benefits 
      as an important functional food ingredient. Therefore, four abundantly growing 
      tropical brown seaweeds-Iyengaria stellata, Spatoglossum asperum, Sargassum 
      linearifolium, and Stoechospermum polypodioides-were collected from the Saurashtra 
      Coast of the Arabian Sea. They were analyzed for metabolite profiling, biochemical 
      activities (including total antioxidant, reducing, scavenging, and 
      anti-proliferative characteristics), and total phenolic and flavonoid contents. A 
      concentration-dependent antioxidant, reducing, and scavenging activities were 
      observed for all four brown seaweeds. The S. asperum and I. stellata extracts showed 
      maximum total antioxidant activity. S. asperum also showed high scavenging and 
      reducing activities compared to other studied brown seaweeds. Further, S. asperum 
      contained high total phenolic and flavonoid content compared to other brown seaweeds 
      collected from the same coast. A multivariate correlation study confirmed a positive 
      correlation between total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and biochemical 
      activities (total antioxidant, scavenging and reducing) for all brown seaweeds. 
      About 35% anti-proliferative activity was observed with S. asperum extract on Huh7 
      cells; in contrast S. polypodioide showed about 44% proliferation inhibition of Huh7 
      cells. Similarly, 26% proliferation inhibition of HeLa cells was observed with S. 
      asperum extract. Overall, S. asperum possesses high total flavonoid and phenolic 
      amounts, and showed potential antioxidant, scavenging and reducing characteristics. 
      The study confirmed the nutraceutical potential of S. asperum and that it could be a 
      promising functional food ingredient.

TI  - The potential of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) as a functional food and 
      nutraceutical and its effects on glycemia and lipidemia.
PG  - 1485-9
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2011.0002 [doi]
AB  - Dietary fiber from fenugreek blunts glucose and cholesterol after a meal and 
      regulates the production of cholesterol in the liver. The mechanisms for these 
      effects have not been fully elucidated. Fenugreek seeds contain 45.4% dietary fiber 
      (32% insoluble and 13.3% soluble), and the gum is composed of galactose and mannose. 
      The latter compounds are associated with reduced glycemia and cholesterolemia. 
      Fenugreek's hypoglycemic effect has been especially documented in humans and animals 
      with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, this dietary fiber has 
      potential for widespread use in the food industry because its galactomannan 
      composition has emulsifying and stabilizing properties. Flour supplemented with 
      8%-10% fenugreek dietary fiber has been used in the production of baked goods such 
      as bread, pizza, muffins, and cakes. This application to flour allows for the 
      production of functional foods that may be widely acceptable to consumers observing 
      western diets.

AB  - With the numerous failures of pharmaceuticals to treat traumatic brain injury in 
      humans, more researchers have become interested in combination therapies. This is 
      largely due to the multimodal nature of damage from injury, which causes 
      excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, edema, neuroinflammation and cell death. Polydrug 
      treatments have the potential to target multiple aspects of the secondary injury 
      cascade, while many previous therapies focused on one particular aspect. Of specific 
      note are vitamins, minerals and nutrients that can be utilized to supplement other 
      therapies. Many of these have low toxicity, are already FDA approved and have 
      minimal interactions with other drugs, making them attractive targets for 
      therapeutics. Over the past 20 years, interest in supplementation and 
      supraphysiologic dosing of nutrients for brain injury has increased and indeed many 
      vitamins and nutrients now have a considerable body of the literature backing their 
      use. Here, we review several of the prominent therapies in the category of 
      nutraceutical treatment for brain injury in experimental models, including vitamins 
      (B2, B3, B6, B9, C, D, E), herbs and traditional medicines (ginseng, Gingko biloba), 
      flavonoids, and other nutrients (magnesium, zinc, carnitine, omega-3 fatty acids). 
      While there is still much work to be done, several of these have strong potential 
      for clinical therapies, particularly with regard to polydrug regimens. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Brain injury and recovery.

TI  - Effects of a nutraceutical supplement on gastrointestinal health in racing 
      standardbreds.
PG  - 558-568
LID - 10.1111/jpn.13508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Feed additives that accelerate gastrointestinal transit time may help 
      support normal gastrointestinal function in horses at risk for impaction colic. 
      Previous research has demonstrated significant stimulatory effect of a hemp-based 
      nutraceutical product (Gs Formula; GF) on contractility of gastric smooth muscle and 
      gastrin production in vitro. OBJECTIVES: To quantify effects of GF on indicators of 
      GIT transit time and tight junction proteins. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized 
      placebo-controlled cross-over study. METHODS: Eight Standardbreds were administered 
      200 plastic beads by nasogastric tube before (baseline; BL) and after receiving a 
      diet containing GF (CON: 0 g/day, LO: 160 g/day or HI: 480 g/day) for 28 days. Total 
      manure collection occurred every 2 hours for 72 hours after bead administration. 
      Outcome measures included GIT transit time, faecal dry matter (DM), water intake, 
      and complete biochemistry and haematology screens. RESULTS: There was no effect of 
      GF on GIT transit time. Faecal output was significantly lower in LO and HI horses 
      than CON horses after 28 days on the supplement. HI horses have significantly lower 
      rouleaux formation and lower faecal DM on Day 28 compared with BL. GF also produced 
      changes in electrolytes associated with pH balance, which may indicate a role for GF 
      as an alkalinizing compound in exercising horses. Clinical pathology results support 
      the safety of GF up to 480 g/day for 28 days with no adverse effects being observed 
      in haematology or biochemistry results. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Future studies on GF 
      should focus on evaluating effect of GF on gastrointestinal transit in horses with 
      naturally or experimentally delayed gastrointestinal motility, and its effect on 
      exercise performance and onset of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: GF may help support normal 
      gastrointestinal function in horses at risk for impaction colic by reducing faecal 
      DM and rouleaux formation.

      mitochondrial cytopathies.
PG  - 1561-7
LID - 10.1016/j.addr.2008.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial cytopathies ultimately lead to a reduction in aerobic energy 
      transduction, depletion of alternative energy stores, increased oxidative stress, 
      apoptosis and necrosis. Specific combinations of nutraceutical compounds can target 
      many of the aforementioned biochemical pathways. Antioxidants combined with 
      cofactors that can bypass specific electron transport chain defects and the 
      provision of alternative energy sources represents a specific targeted strategy. To 
      date, there has been only one randomized double-blind clinical trial using a 
      combination nutraceutial therapy and it showed that the combination of creatine 
      monohydrate, coenzyme Q10, and alpha-lipoic acid reduced lactate and markers of 
      oxidative stress in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies. Future studies need to 
      use larger numbers of patients with well defined clinical and surrogate marker 
      outcomes to clarify the potential role for combination nutraceuticals 
      ("mitochondrial cocktail") as a therapy for mitochondrial cytopathies.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a botanical-based equine 
      nutraceutical on contractility of gastric smooth muscle in vitro. Gastric ulcers are 
      prevalent in performance horses and negatively impact horse welfare. Gastric 
      hypermotility has been positively associated with the development of gastric 
      ulceration in nonequine species, and reduction of hypermotility may be protective 
      against their development. Stomachs from 12 pigs processed for food at a 
      provincially inspected abattoir were collected within 1 hour of slaughter. Explants 
      of nonglandular gastric tissue were prepared and suspended in a tissue bath, 
      attached to a force transducer, in the presence or absence of a simulated digest 
      extract of the nutraceutical. Tissue was stimulated to contract using increasing 
      doses of acetylcholine. Peak and mean contractile force over 1 and 2 minutes after 
      exposure to acetylcholine were measured. Exposure of gastric smooth muscle to the 
      nutraceutical significantly reduced contractility of the tissue. These data provide 
      support for the use of this nutraceutical to reduce contractility of nonglandular 
      gastric smooth muscle and may indicate a protective effect of this nutraceutical in 
      horses with mechanically induced gastric ulcers. Future studies are needed to 
      clarify the role of gastric hypermotility on development of equine gastric ulcers 
      and to determine the effect of this nutraceutical on equine gastric contractility 
      and ulcerogenesis in vivo.

TI  - Gazing into the crystal ball: future considerations for ensuring sustained growth of 
      the functional food and nutraceutical marketplace.
PG  - 12-21
LID - 10.1017/S0954422412000236 [doi]
AB  - Over the last decade the concept of functional foods and nutraceuticals (FFN) has 
      gained support from various stakeholders including the food industry, scientific and 
      academic community, government institutions or regulators, producers and consumers. 
      However, as one begins to evaluate the global FFN industry, several issues emerge 
      including (i) a lack of consensus across jurisdictions for acknowledging safe and 
      efficacious FFN, (ii) challenges regarding the classification of novel food-derived 
      bioactives as FFN or drugs, and (iii) a disconnect between nutrient requirements and 
      dosages of FFN required to facilitate health benefits. The objectives of the present 
      review are to discuss the role of existing stakeholders within the FFN marketplace 
      and identify performance indicators for growth within the FFN sector. In addition, 
      the following report provides feasible resolutions to present and future challenges 
      facing the global FFN industry to ensure sustained long-term growth.

TI  - Control of the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in honey bees (Apis mellifera) 
      using nutraceutical and immuno-stimulatory compounds.

LID - e0227484
AB  - Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite that causes nosemosis in the honey bee 
      (Apis mellifera). As alternatives to the antibiotic fumagillin, ten nutraceuticals 
      (oregano oil, thymol, carvacrol, trans-cinnmaldehyde, tetrahydrocurcumin, 
      sulforaphane, naringenin, embelin, allyl sulfide, hydroxytyrosol) and two 
      immuno-stimulatory compounds (chitosan, poly I:C) were examined for controlling N. 
      ceranae infections. Caged bees were inoculated with N. ceranae spores, and 
      treatments were administered in sugar syrup. Only two compounds did not 
      significantly reduce N. ceranae spore counts compared to the infected positive 
      control, but the most effective were sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, 
      carvacrol from oregano oil, and naringenin from citrus fruit. When tested at several 
      concentrations, the highest sulforaphane concentration reduced spore counts by 100%, 
      but also caused 100% bee mortality. For carvacrol, the maximum reduction in spore 
      counts was 57% with an intermediate concentration and the maximum bee mortality was 
      23% with the highest concentration. For naringenin, the maximum reduction in spore 
      counts was 64% with the highest concentration, and the maximum bee mortality was 
      only 15% with an intermediate concentration. In the longevity experiment, 
      naringenin-fed bees lived as long as Nosema-free control bees, both of which lived 
      significantly longer than infected positive control bees. While its antimicrobial 
      properties may be promising, reducing sulforaphane toxicity to bees is necessary 
      before it can be considered as a candidate for controlling N. ceranae. Although 
      further work on formulation is needed with naringenin, its effect on extending 
      longevity in infected bees may give it an additional value as a potential additive 
      for bee feed in honey bee colonies.

AB  - The importance of consuming functional foods has led the food industry to look for 
      alternative sources of ingredients of natural origin. Eggplants are a type of 
      vegetable that is valued for its content in phytochemical compounds and it is due to 
      the fact that this research is conducted towards the development of eggplant flour 
      as a proposal to be used as a functional ingredient in the food industry. In this 
      study, the eggplant fruits were divided into four groups, based on the drying method 
      and the equipment used: Minced, drying oven (T1); sliced, drying oven (T2); sliced 
      and frozen, drying tunnel (T3); and sliced, drying tunnel (T4). All the eggplant 
      flours showed the same trend regarding their antioxidant capacity and phenolic 
      content in the order T2 > T4 > T1 > T3. The freezing of eggplant was found to have a 
      negative effect on functional and antioxidant properties. With respect to their 
      nutritional composition, the flours did not change in their crude fiber, protein, 
      and fat contents. In general terms, the T2 flour is a potential ingredient for the 
      preparation of foods with functional properties since it is rich in phenolic 
      compounds and antioxidants.

TI  - Nutraceutical intervention with colostrum replacer: Can we reduce disease hazard, 
      ameliorate disease severity, and improve performance in preweaned dairy calves?
PG  - 7168-7176

AB  - The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to determine if an intervention 
      with colostrum replacer (CR; Premolac Plus, Zinpro; 125 g/d fed for 3 d) or a 
      placebo milk replacer (Cows Match, Land O'Lakes Inc.; 125 g/d for 3 d) following a 
      triggered alarm could ameliorate disease bouts in dairy calves. The alarm was set to 
      detect negative deviations of milk intake (20% reduction) or drinking speed (30% 
      reduction) in relation to a calf's 12-d rolling average feeding behavior. Calves 
      were enrolled on this study (n = 42 CR, n = 42 placebo) when they triggered an alarm 
      from d 14 to 50 on the feeder before weaning. Once calves were enrolled, calves 
      received a bottle of either 125 g of CR or milk replacer mixed with 1 L of water for 
      3 d. Calves were enrolled on the automated milk feeder at age 4.0 ± 2.0 d (mean ± 
      SD), were offered 10 L/d of the same milk replacer fed as a placebo, and had ad 
      libitum access to calf starter measured by automated feeders. Weaning began at d 50, 
      with 50% reduction of milk replacer across 14 d, and an additional 20% reduction for 
      another 7 d before weaning at d 70. Calves were health scored from birth to 2 wk 
      postweaning (88 ± 2.0 d of age) daily for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and 
      diarrhea, and were weighed and scored using lung ultrasonography twice weekly. A BRD 
      score ≥5 and an area of consolidated lung ≥3.0 cm(2) was considered BRD positive; 
      diarrhea was defined as a watery fecal consistency that sifted through the bedding. 
      The effect of CR on BRD and diarrhea likelihood were calculated with logistic 
      models; the 7 d before and after an alarm were fixed effects, with milk intake as a 
      covariate. A Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the effect of CR on the hazard 
      of being positive for BRD and diarrhea following enrollment, with sex as a fixed 
      effect in the diarrhea model. The effect of CR on average daily gain the week 
      following intervention was evaluated with linear modeling with repeated measures, 
      and birth date was a random effect. After intervention, placebo calves had 1.64 (95% 
      CI: 1.11-2.43) times greater odds of having a BRD bout compared with CR calves for 
      the 7 d following intervention. Moreover, placebo calves had 1.50 (95% CI: 
      1.11-2.08) times greater odds of having lobar lung consolidation in the 7 d after 
      intervention than CR calves. No difference was found in the likelihood of diarrhea 
      in the 7 d after intervention (odds ratio: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.71-1.16). However, 
      placebo calves had a 2.38 (95% CI: 1.30-4.33) times greater hazard of incurring BRD 
      in the 14 d after intervention. Average daily gain was not associated with an 
      intervention with CR for the 7 d after intervention (placebo: 0.73 ± 0.07 kg/d; CR: 
      0.70 ± 0.08 kg/d; LSM ± SEM). These results suggest CR may reduce BRD likelihood but 
      did not influence growth in calves offered high allowances of milk. Future research 
      should examine which properties of CR ameliorate BRD in calves.

TI  - Role of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration: recent developments in assay methods 
      for oxidative stress and nutraceutical antioxidants.
PG  - 771-99
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the course of normal metabolism and 
      they serve important physiological functions. However, because of their high 
      reactivity, accumulation of ROS beyond the immediate needs of the cell may affect 
      cellular structure and functional integrity, by bringing about oxidative degradation 
      of critical molecules, such as the DNA, proteins, and lipids. Although cells possess 
      an intricate network of defense mechanisms to neutralize excess ROS and reduce 
      oxidative stress, some tissues, especially the brain, are much more vulnerable to 
      oxidative stress because of their elevated consumption of oxygen and the consequent 
      generation of large amounts of ROS. For the same reason, the mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) of brain cells is highly susceptible to structural alterations resulting in 
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that these 
      effects of ROS may be etiologically related to a number of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Nutraceutical antioxidants are dietary supplements that can exert 
      positive pharmacological effects on specific human diseases by neutralizing the 
      negative effects of ROS. The present communication concentrates on a review of 
      recent concepts and methodological developments, some of them based on the results 
      of work from our own laboratory, on the following aspects: (1) the complex 
      interactions and complementary interrelationships between oxidative stress, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, and various forms of neural degeneration; (2) 
      fractionation and isolation of substances with antioxidant properties from plant 
      materials, which are extensively used in the human diet and, therefore, can be 
      expected to be less toxic in any pharmacological intervention; (3) recent 
      developments in methodologies that can be used for the assay of oxidative stress and 
      determination of biological activities of exogenous and endogenous antioxidants; and 
      (4) presentation of simple procedures based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the resulting amplicon for 
      investigations of structural alterations in mtDNA.

TI  - Biomarker and dietary validation of a Canadian food frequency questionnaire to 
      measure eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid intakes from whole food, 
      functional food, and nutraceutical sources.
PG  - 1005-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jand.2012.03.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canadian dietary sources of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) include marine and non-marine whole foods, functional 
      foods, and nutraceuticals. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: In the present study, these sources 
      were incorporated into a nutrient-specific, semi-quantitative food frequency 
      questionnaire (FFQ) and the ability to measure the EPA and DHA intakes of Canadian 
      adults was assessed. Specifically, the EPA and DHA intakes estimated by FFQ of 78 
      men and women, 20 to 60 years of age, were compared with EPA and DHA measurements 
      from 3-day food records and measures of EPA and DHA in fasting whole blood. RESULTS: 
      Mean (±standard deviation) and median intakes of EPA+DHA were 0.34±0.34 and 0.21 
      g/day by FFQ and 0.47±0.71 and 0.13 g/day by food record, with no significant 
      differences between mean intakes (P=0.93). The FFQ provided higher estimates than 
      the food record at low intakes of EPA and DHA and lower estimates at high intakes 
      based on Bland-Altman plots. The FFQ was moderately correlated with food record 
      (r=0.31 to 0.49) and with blood biomarker measures of EPA and DHA (r=0.31 to 0.51). 
      Agreement analysis revealed that 42% of participants were classified in the same and 
      77% into same or adjacent quartile when EPA and DHA intake was assessed by food 
      record and by FFQ. Similar quartile agreement was found for EPA and DHA intakes by 
      FFQ with blood biomarker EPA and DHA. The range of the validity coefficients, 
      calculated using the method of triads, was 0.43 to 0.71 for FFQ measurement of 
      EPA+DHA. CONCLUSIONS: The FFQ is an adequate tool for estimating usual EPA and DHA 
      intakes and ranking Canadian adults by their intakes.

TI  - Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid: A Pharmaco-Nutraceutical Approach to Improve the 
      Responsiveness to Ursodeoxycholic Acid.
LID - 10.3390/nu13082617 [doi]
LID - 2617
AB  - Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line therapy for the treatment of 
      cholestatic and autoimmune liver diseases. Its clinical use is currently limited by 
      a significant proportion of non-responder patients. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 
      PUFAs) possess important anti-inflammatory properties and protect liver cells 
      against bile acid (BA)-induced toxicity. The present study was designed to rapidly 
      evaluate whether combining n-3 PUFAs (i.e., eicosapentaenoic [EPA] and 
      docosahexaenoic [DHA] acids) to UDCA would provide additional benefits when compared 
      to the drug alone. The parameters evaluated were (i) the expression of genes 
      governing BA synthesis, transport, and metabolism; (ii) the prevention of BA-induced 
      apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress; and (iii) the control of BA- and 
      LPS-dependent inflammation. In the absence of n-3 PUFAs, most of the parameters 
      investigated were unaffected by UDCA or were only altered by the higher dose (500 
      µM) of the drug. By contrast, in the presence of EPA/DHA (50/50 µM), all parameters 
      showed a strongly improved response and the lowest UDCA dosage (50 µM) provided 
      equal or better benefits than the highest dose used alone. For example, the 
      combination EPA/DHA + UDCA 50 µM caused comparable down-regulation of the CYP7A1 
      gene expression and of the BA-induced caspase 3 activity as observed with UDCA 500 
      µM. In conclusion, these results suggest that the addition of n-3 PUFAs to UDCA may 
      improve the response to the drug, and that such a pharmaco-nutraceutical approach 
      could be used in clinic to open the narrow therapeutic dose of UDCA in cholestatic 
      liver diseases.

TI  - Thymoquinone from nutraceutical black cumin oil activates Neu4 sialidase in live 
      macrophage, dendritic, and normal and type I sialidosis human fibroblast cells via 
      GPCR Galphai proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9.

AB  - Anti-inflammatory activities of thymoquinone (TQ) have been demonstrated in in vitro 
      and in vivo studies. However, the precise mechanism(s) of TQ in these 
      anti-inflammatory activities is not well understood. Using a newly developed assay 
      to detect sialidase activity in live macrophage cells (Glycoconj J doi: 
      10.1007/s10719-009-9239-8 ), here we show that TQ has no inhibitory effect on 
      endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced sialidase activity in live BMC-2 
      macrophage cells. In contrast, the parent black seed oil (BSO) and another 
      constituent of BSO para-cymene (p-CY) completely block LPS induced sialidase 
      activity. All of these compounds had no effect on cell viability. On the other hand, 
      TQ induces a vigorous sialidase activity in live BMC-2 macrophage cells in a dose 
      dependent manner as well in live DC-2.4 dendritic cells, HEK-TLR4/MD2, HEK293, SP1 
      mammary adenocarcinoma cells, human WT and 1140F01 and WG0544 type I sialidosis 
      fibroblast cells. Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) inhibits TQ-induced sialidase 
      activity in live BMC-2 cells with an IC(50) of 0.0194 microM compared to an IC(50) 
      of 19.1 microM for neuraminidase inhibitor DANA 
      (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid). Anti-Neu1, -2 and -3 antibodies have 
      no inhibition of TQ-induced sialidase activity in live BMC-2 and human THP-1 
      macrophage cells but anti-Neu4 antibodies completely block this activity. There is a 
      vigorous sialidase activity associated with TQ treated live primary bone marrow (BM) 
      macrophage cells derived from WT and hypomorphic cathepsin A mice with a secondary 
      Neu1 deficiency (NeuI KD), but not from Neu4 knockout (Neu4 KO) mice. Pertussis 
      toxin (PTX), a specific inhibitor of Galphai proteins of G-protein coupled receptor 
      (GPCR) and the broad range inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) galardin and 
      piperazine applied to live BMC-2, THP-1 and primary BM macrophage cells completely 
      block TQ-induced sialidase activity. These same inhibitory effects are not observed 
      with the GM1 ganglioside specific cholera toxin subunit B (CTXB) as well as with 
      CTX, tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a, and the broad range GPCR inhibitor suramin. 
      The specific inhibitor of MMP-9, anti-MMP-9 antibody and anti-Neu4 antibody, but not 
      the specific inhibitor of MMP-3 completely block TQ-induced sialidase activity in 
      live THP-1 cells, which express Neu4 and MMP-9 on the cell surface. Neu4 sialidase 
      activity in cell lysates from TQ-treated live THP-1 cells desialylates natural 
      gangliosides and mucin substrates. RT-PCR and western blot analyses reveal no 
      correlation between mRNA and protein values for Neu3 and Neu4 in human monocytic 
      THP-1 cells, suggesting for the first time a varied post-transcriptional mechanism 
      for these two mammalian sialidases independent of TQ activation. Our findings 
      establish an unprecedented activation of Neu4 sialidase on the cell surface by 
      thymoquinone, which is derived from the nutraceutical black cumin oil. The 
      potentiation of GPCR-signaling by TQ via membrane targeting of Galphai subunit 
      proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activation may be involved in the activation 
      process of Neu4 sialidase on the cell surface.

AB  - Microspheres (15-25 microm) of soy protein isolate (SPI), zein, and SPI/zein blends 
      were prepared using a cold gelation method as possible delivery systems for 
      nutraceutical products. Microsphere matrix crystalline structure, swelling behavior, 
      and nutrient load release kinetics in simulated gastrointestinal fluids were 
      investigated. SPI microspheres showed early burst release of the model nutrient, 
      whereas zein microspheres showed very slow release in both simulated gastric and 
      intestinal fluids. Blending of SPI and zein provides a convenient method of 
      adjusting the hydrophobicity and crystallinity of the protein matrix and hence its 
      swelling behavior and in vivo nutrient release kinetics. Diffusion plays a major 
      role in regulating nutrient release. SPI/zein microspheres blended at ratios of 5:5 
      and 3:7 showed near zero-order release kinetics over the test period in simulated 
      intestinal buffer and thus have potential as delivery vehicles for nutraceutical 
      products in functional foods.

TI  - Evaluation of inflammatory responses induced via intra-articular injection of

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate inflammatory responses induced via intra-articular 
      recombinant human interleukin (IL)-1beta treatment in horses receiving a dietary 
      nutraceutical (DN; composed of mussel, shark cartilage, abalone, and Biota 
      orientalis lipid extract) and assess the clinical effects of long-term DN 
      administration. ANIMALS: 22 healthy horses. PROCEDURES: 12 horses were fed 0, 15, 
      45, or 75 mg of DN (3 horses/treatment) daily for 84 days. General health and 
      clinicopathologic variables were monitored at intervals. Ten other horses received 0 
      or 15 g of DN/d (5 horses/treatment) for 29 days (beginning day -14). One 
      intercarpal joint in each horse was injected twice with IL-1beta (10 and 100 ng on 
      days 0 and 1, respectively), and the contralateral joint was similarly injected with 
      saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Synovial fluid prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), sulfated 
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG), nitric oxide (NO), and protein concentrations and leukocyte 
      counts were analyzed before and at intervals after injections. RESULTS: 
      Administration of the DN (up to 75 g/d) to horses for 84 days did not induce any 
      adverse effects. In the other experiment, synovial fluid PGE(2), GAG, and protein 
      concentrations and leukocyte count increased after intra-articular injections of 
      IL-1beta (compared with effects of saline solution injections) in horses that 
      received no DN; NO concentration was not affected. In horses that were fed the DN, 
      intra-articular IL-1beta injections did not induce significant increases in synovial 
      fluid PGE(2) and GAG concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results 
      suggested that administration of the DN may be useful in preventing inflammation 
      associated with arthritis and degenerative joint disease in horses.

TI  - Influence of Excipients and Spray Drying on the Physical and Chemical Properties of 
      Nutraceutical Capsules Containing Phytochemicals from Black Bean Extract.
PG  - 21626-35
LID - 10.3390/molecules201219792 [doi]
AB  - Black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a rich source of flavonoids and saponins 
      with proven health benefits. Spray dried black bean extract powders were used in 
      different formulations for the production of nutraceutical capsules with reduced 
      batch-to-batch weight variability. Factorial designs were used to find an adequate 
      maltodextrin-extract ratio for the spray-drying process to produce black bean 
      extract powders. Several flowability properties were used to determine composite 
      flow index of produced powders. Powder containing 6% maltodextrin had the highest 
      yield (78.6%) and the best recovery of flavonoids and saponins (>56% and >73%, 
      respectively). The new complexes formed by the interaction of black bean powder with 
      maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose 50 and starch exhibited not only bigger 
      particles, but also a rougher structure than using only maltodextrin and starch as 
      excipients. A drying process prior to capsule production improved powder 
      flowability, increasing capsule weight and reducing variability. The formulation 
      containing 25.0% of maltodextrin, 24.1% of microcrystalline cellulose 50, 50% of 
      starch and 0.9% of magnesium stearate produced capsules with less than 2.5% weight 
      variability. The spray drying technique is a feasible technique to produce good flow 
      extract powders containing valuable phytochemicals and low cost excipients to reduce 
      the end-product variability.

      Encapsulation and release of curcumin using mealworm protein-chitosan

AB  - The potential of using insect proteins to encapsulate and protect hydrophobic 
      nutraceuticals within biopolymer nano-complexes was examined. Insect proteins were 
      used to form nanoparticles that were uncoated or coated with chitosan. Initially, 
      the nature of the curcumin-mealworm protein interaction was investigated. Curcumin 
      mainly interacted with the hydrophobic core of the insect protein nanoparticles 
      through hydrophobic forces. About one curcumin molecule bound per protein molecule 
      in both the absence and presence of chitosan. The binding constants (K) were 
      1.1 × 10(4) M(-1) and 0.7 × 10(4) M(-1) for curcumin loaded in the uncoated and 
      coated nanoparticles, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry showed 
      increased thermal stability of the proteins after interaction with curcumin or 
      chitosan. Encapsulation efficiency of the curcumin within the biopolymer 
      nano-complexes was 30-47% depending on the system. Transmission electron microscopy 
      and dynamic light scattering analysis showed that the biopolymer nano-complexes were 
      spherical and relatively small (d = 143-178 nm). FTIR suggests that curcumin was 
      stabilized more effectively in the coated nano-complexes, due to non-covalent 
      intermolecular interactions. Curcumin release under oral, gastric, and intestinal 
      conditions showed that over 90% of the nutraceutical was released after exposure to 
      model gastrointestinal conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of using 
      insect proteins for fabricating colloidal delivery systems for water-insoluble 
      nutraceuticals.

AB  - Over the last few decades, substrates with immune-modulating properties have been 
      identified in all groups of micro- and macronutrients. Numerous experimental studies 
      have focused on evaluating these substances, either alone or in combination. After 
      hundreds of experiments, no clear, consistent signal exists that any of these agents 
      result in significant treatment benefits in critically ill patients. The current 
      approach to establishing the efficacy of nutritional interventions suffers from 
      several limitations. First, the majority of studies focus on surrogate or substitute 
      end points rather than clinically important end points. Second, the majority of 
      clinical studies are small, and as such are underpowered to detect a significant 
      treatment effect on clinically important end points. Third, the methodological 
      quality of individual randomized trials varies. Methodological limitations, 
      prevalent in nutrition studies, limit the strength of clinical inference that can be 
      made from study results. High quality studies have been shown to differ 
      significantly from low quality studies in their estimation of treatment effect. 
      Fourth, the generalizability of single-site studies is limited. Finally, studies 
      sponsored solely by industry are considered to be less believable than studies 
      conducted under the auspices of peer-review agencies. Future evaluations must be 
      done in the context of large, multicenter, well-designed, randomized trials focusing 
      on clinically important end points that are sponsored from a variety of sources 
      (including peer-reviewed agencies). Although such trials are costly, they are 
      feasible and are much more likely to be believable and generalizable than the 
      current approach.

TI  - Chitosan/beta-lactoglobulin core-shell nanoparticles as nutraceutical carriers.
PG  - 6041-53
AB  - Chitosan (CS)/beta-lactoglobulin (betalg) core-shell nanoparticles (CS-betalg 
      nanoparticle) were successfully prepared with the aim of developing a biocompatible 
      carrier for the oral administration of nutraceuticals. The effects of pH and initial 
      concentrations (C(beta)(lg)) of native and denatured betalg on the properties of the 
      nanoparticles were investigated. Uniform nanoparticles were prepared by ionic 
      gelation with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). The surface charge of the particles was 
      positive, with a zeta potential of 20-60 mV. (beta)lg loading efficiency (LE) 
      spanned a broad range (1-60%); and was highly sensitive to formulation pH. This 
      adsorption can be mainly attributed to electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions and 
      hydrogen bonding between (beta)lg and CS. Brilliant blue (BB) release experiments 
      showed that the nanoparticles prepared with native (beta)lg had favorable properties 
      to resist acid and pepsin degradation in simulated gastric conditions unlike those 
      prepared with denatured (beta)lg or denatured (beta)lg crosslinked with Ca2+. When 
      transferred to simulated intestinal conditions, the (beta)lg shells of the 
      nanoparticles were degraded by pancreatin.

TI  - Effects of simulated digests of Biota orientalis and a dietary nutraceutical on 
      interleukin-1- induced inflammatory responses in cartilage explants.
PG  - 1560-8
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.69.12.1560 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that simulated digests of Biota orientalis (BO) 
      and a dietary nutraceutical (DN; composed of mussel, shark cartilage, abalone, and 
      BO seed lipid extract) inhibit prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), and 
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production in interleukin (IL)-1-stimulated cartilage 
      explants. SAMPLE POPULATION: Cartilage tissue from 12 pigs. PROCEDURES: Articular 
      cartilage explants were conditioned with a simulated digest of BO (BOsim) or DN 
      (DNsim) at concentrations of 0, 0.06, or 0.18 mg/mL or indomethacin (INDOsim; 0 or 
      0.02 mg/mL) for 72 hours. Control explants received digest vehicle only. Explants 
      were or were not stimulated with recombinant human-IL-1beta (10 or 0 ng/mL) during 
      the final 48 hours of culture. Concentrations of PGE2, GAG, and NO in media samples 
      (mPGE2,mGAG, and mNO concentrations, respectively) were analyzed, and explant tissue 
      was stained fluorochromatically to determine chondrocyte viability. Treatment 
      effects during the final 48-hour culture period were analyzed. RESULTS: IL-1 
      increased mPGE2, mGAG, and mNO concentrations in control explants without adversely 
      affecting cell viability. Treatment with INDOsim blocked PGE2 production and 
      increased mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants and 
      increased mGAG concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with DNsim (0.06 
      and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE2 concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated 
      explants, reduced mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated explants, and increased mNO 
      concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with 0.18 mg of DNsim/mL increased 
      cell viability in the presence of IL-1. In IL-1-stimulated explants, BOsim (0.06 and 
      0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE2 concentration, but 0.18 mg of BOsim/mL increased cell 
      viability. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Effects of IL-1 on cartilage explants 
      in vitro were modulated by DNsim and BOsim.

AB  - Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was encapsulated successfully in a nutraceutical formulation 
      composed of calcium caseinate, flaxseed oil and lecithin. The effect of CoQ10 on the 
      physico-chemical stability of emulsions was compared to emulsions without CoQ10. 
      According to ATR-FTIR analysis, emulsions were found to be more stable in the 
      presence of CoQ10. The emulsion with CoQ10 was used as a functional cream in the 
      cheese making process. The retention rate of CoQ10, composition and cheese yield 
      were also determined. Quantification of CoQ10 by HPLC showed that the retention of 
      this lipophilic agent into cheese matrix was 93% and equivalent to the total lipid 
      retention. Protein retention and cheese yield were not affected by the addition of 
      the functional cream. For the first time, CoQ10 has been encapsulated in a cheese 
      matrix, hence demonstrating that CoQ10 could be used in the development of 
      functional cheeses.

TI  - Novel protein-lipid composite nanoparticles with an inner aqueous compartment as 
      delivery systems of hydrophilic nutraceutical compounds.
PG  - 10629-10640
LID - 10.1039/c8nr01009a [doi]
AB  - Food protein and lipid based nanoparticles have attracted recent interest as a means 
      of delivering nutraceuticals. Nanoparticle encapsulation of nutraceuticals faces 
      challenges to overcome for it to be readily applied in the food industry, such as 
      low encapsulation efficiency for hydrophilic compounds and poor stability once in 
      the gastrointestinal tract. This research introduces a new protein-lipid composite 
      nanoparticle with a three-layered structure (a barley protein layer, α-tocopherol 
      layer and phospholipid layer) and an inner aqueous compartment to load hydrophilic 
      nutraceuticals. This delivery system showed efficient encapsulation of vitamin B12 
      (69%) and controlled release behavior in simulated gastrointestinal media. An in 
      vitro cell evaluation demonstrated that nanoparticles could internalize into Caco-2 
      cells via energy-dependent endocytosis and significantly increase the uptake and 
      transport efficiency of vitamin B12 in this model. In vivo, the developed vitamin 
      B12 loaded nanoparticle showed increased serum vitamin B12 levels upon oral 
      administration and reduced the methylmalonic acid level more efficiently than the 
      free form in rats. A 14-day in vivo toxicity study showed no evidence of toxicity in 
      rats implying the safety of the developed nanoparticles in long term use. Overall, 
      the results of this study show the great potential of the developed nanoparticles in 
      increasing the absorption of vitamin B12 upon oral administration.

TI  - Molecular analysis of ∆6 desaturase and ∆6 elongase from Conidiobolus obscurus in 
      the biosynthesis of eicosatetraenoic acid, a ω3 fatty acid with nutraceutical 
      potentials.
PG  - 591-601
LID - 10.1007/s00253-010-3060-y [doi]
AB  - Conidiobolus obscurus, an entomopathogenic fungus able to infect aphids, was 
      previously reported to produce substantial amounts of very long chain 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) that may mediate the insect infection. 
      However, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these VLCPUFAs from the order 
      Entomophthorales have yet to be identified. Using degenerate reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of the cDNA end 
      methods, we cloned a ∆6 desaturase cDNA (CoD6) and a ∆6 elongase cDNA (CoE6) from C. 
      obscurus. Expression of CoD6 and CoE6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed CoD6 
      could introduce a Δ6 double bond into α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), and CoE6 
      preferentially elongated 18-carbon Δ6 desaturated fatty acid stearidonic acid 
      (18:4n-3). When the fungus was grown under a temperature shift from 20 °C to 10 °C, 
      the transcript level of CoD6 and CoE6 increased, whereas when the fungal culture was 
      shifted from 20 °C to 30 °C, the transcript level of both genes decreased. The 
      entire eicosatetraenoic acid biosynthetic pathway was reconstituted in yeast using 
      four genes, CoD6 and CoE6 from C. obscurus, CpDes12 (a Δ12 desaturase) and CpDesX (a 
      ω3 desaturase) from Claviceps purpurea. Yeast transformants expressing the four 
      genes produced ten new fatty acids including the final product eicosatetraenoic acid 
      (ETA). This represents the reconstitution of the entire ETA pathway in yeast without 
      supplementation of any exogenous fatty acids.
