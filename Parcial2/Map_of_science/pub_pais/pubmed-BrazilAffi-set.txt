TI  - Nutraceutical Potential of Carica papaya in Metabolic Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/nu11071608 [doi]
LID - 1608
AB  - Carica papaya L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs 
      in tropical and subtropical regions. The pulp contains vitamins A, C, and E, B 
      complex vitamins, such as pantothenic acid and folate, and minerals, such as 
      magnesium and potassium, as well as food fibers. Phenolic compounds, such as benzyl 
      isothiocyanate, glucosinolates, tocopherols (α and δ), β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene 
      and carotenoids, are found in the seeds. The oil extracted from the seed principally 
      presents oleic fatty acid followed by palmitic, linoleic and stearic acids, whereas 
      the leaves have high contents of food fibers and polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, 
      saponins, pro-anthocyanins, tocopherol, and benzyl isothiocyanate. Studies 
      demonstrated that the nutrients present in its composition have beneficial effects 
      on the cardiovascular system, protecting it against cardiovascular illnesses and 
      preventing harm caused by free radicals. It has also been reported that it aids in 
      the treatment of diabetes mellitus and in the reduction of cholesterol levels. Thus, 
      both the pulp and the other parts of the plant (leaves and seeds) present 
      antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic actions, which, in 
      turn, can contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated 
      metabolic disorders.

TI  - Nutraceutical and Medicinal Potential of the Morus Species in Metabolic 
      Dysfunctions.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20020301 [doi]
LID - 301
AB  - Many populations use medicinal plants as a therapeutic treatment, due to their lower 
      cost and greater access. Among the plant species used for medicinal purposes are 
      those of the genus Morus. The most known species are Morus alba, rubra, and nigra. 
      This review aims to collect data from the literature, predominantly from cell and 
      animal studies, which presents a possible nutraceutical and medicinal potential of 
      the species Morus for use in metabolic dysfunctions. The fruits and leaves of 
      mulberry are used for therapeutic purposes. For scientific confirmation of these 
      effects, they were studied for laxative properties, antibacterial activity, 
      anti-atherogenic activity, and hepatoprotective function. Furthermore, the genus 
      Morus is recognized for the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus, through 
      its hypoglycemic action. It may also provide health benefits through 
      immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive effects. It has been found 
      that the Morus species have phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and anthocyanins that 
      act as important antioxidants and promote beneficial effects on human health. These 
      phytochemical compounds differ among species. Blackberry (Morus nigra) are rich in 
      flavonoids, while the white mulberry (Morus alba) has low concentrations of 
      flavonoids and anthocyanins. In addition, another important factor is to ensure a 
      complete exemption of toxic risks in the use of medicinal plants for the treatment 
      of diseases. Studies have shown no toxic effects by the administration of extracts 
      of Morus species. Thus, the mulberry tree presents nutraceutical potential. It is 
      therefore a promising alternative for medicinal products based on medicinal plants.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiovascular (CV) diseases account for most worldwide mortality, and a 
      higher level of lipoprotein (Lp)-(a) is recognized as a prevalent contributing risk 
      factor. However, there is no consensus regarding nutritional strategies for lowering 
      Lp(a) concentration. Thus, the purposes of this literature review were to: (1) 
      critically examine data concerning the effects of dietetic interventions and 
      nutraceutical agents on Lp(a) level; and (2) review the feasibility and utility of 
      their clinical use. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for studies published 
      between August 2018 and March 2019. The search was performed using the Cochrane, 
      Medline, and Web of Science databases. In order to expand the research, there were 
      no delimitations on the type or year of the studies. A total of 1932 articles were 
      identified using this search procedure. After duplicates were eliminated, 740 
      abstracts of articles written in English were screened to identify those of highest 
      relevance. In the final tally, a total of 152 full-text articles were included in 
      this review. FINDINGS: Several foods and decreases in saturated fat and ethanol 
      intake, especially red wine intake, may lower Lp(a) concentration, but limits are 
      necessary. Coffee and tea intake may decrease Lp(a) level; further investigation is 
      crucial before they can be considered potent Lp(a)-lowering agents. Among 
      supplementation strategies, only l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 are promising clinical 
      candidates to lower Lp(a) level. Since both l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 
      supplementation are commonly used for CV support, they deserve further exploration 
      regarding clinical applicability. In contrast, despite potential CV benefits, 
      current research fails to justify use of higher intakes of vitamin C, soy 
      isoflavones, garlic, and ω-3 for decreasing Lp(a) concentration. IMPLICATIONS: 
      Definitive long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm the effects of dietetic 
      interventions and nutraceutical agents on Lp(a) concentration when anticipating 
      improved CV outcomes.

AB  - There are relatively few studies concerning the use of coffee leaves for medicinal 
      purposes and the composition of secondary plant substances. Therefore, we identified 
      and quantitated polyphenolic compounds along with caffeine present in methanol 
      extracts of Coffea arabica leaves from three different regions of Brazil (Ceará, 
      Minas Gerais and São Paulo) by HPLC-ESI-MS. In addition, correlations between 
      polyphenolic content of the coffee leaves and antioxidant assays DPPH, FRAP and ORAC 
      were evaluated. Fifteen compounds belonging to three classes of polyphenols 
      (xanthones, chlorogenic acids and flavonoids) along with the alkaloid caffeine were 
      detected. The mean concentration of total polyphenolic compounds in the leaves of C. 
      arabica, harvested from three different regions of Brazil was quite variable. The 
      highest values were detected in the coffee leaves harvested in Minas Gerais (n = 4) 
      at 40.80(13.00) g/kg (SD), followed by coffee leaves harvested in São Paulo (n = 20) 
      at 24.79(20.19) g/kg, and the lowest in coffee leaves harvested in Ceará (n = 11) in 
      the Northeast of Brazil at 10.30(5.61) g/kg. The three classes of polyphenols, all 
      showed excellent correlations in the antioxidant assays. Coffee leaf tea, appears to 
      be an excellent functional beverage, with its high content of polyphenolic 
      compounds, which may render positive biologic effects, when inbibed as part of the 
      normal human diet.

AB  - This study developed and carried out an in vitro evaluation of nutraceutical 
      formulations composed of potentially probiotic Limosilactobacillus fermentum (L. 
      fermentum 139, L. fermentum 263 or L. fermentum 296), quercetin and/or resveratrol. 
      L. fermentum strains had counts of >9 log CFU/g and contents of QUE and RES of 
      >200 µg/mg in formulations after freeze-drying. Formulations with QUE and RES 
      protected L. fermentum during exposure to in vitro acidic stomach conditions. L. 
      fermentum strains had counts of >6 log CFU/g on day 60 and/or 90 of refrigeration 
      storage. Contents of QUE (>29%) and RES (>50%) in formulations were potentially 
      bioaccessible. Higher counts of L. fermentum and higher contents of QUE and RES were 
      found in formulations stored under refrigerated rather than under room temperature. 
      All nutraceutical formulations had antioxidant properties. Combinations of probiotic 
      L. fermentum and QUE and/or RES should be an innovative strategy to develop 
      added-value nutraceutical formulations.

AB  - We aimed to determine whether the use of injectable vitamins and minerals improves 
      growth performance and immune and antioxidant responses in dairy calves during pre- 
      and post-weaning period in summer. Twenty dairy calves (45 days of age) were 
      randomized to two groups (10 each): control group (CON) and treated group [TREAT; 
      injection providing 0.20, 0.80, 0.20, 0.10, 35 and 1 mg/kg of copper, zinc, 
      manganese selenium, and vitamins A and E, during two periods (15 days pre- and 15 
      days post-weaning)]. The animals were weighed and blood samples were collected on 
      days 1, 15, 30 and 45 of the study. Levels of serum copper, selenium, zinc, and 
      manganese were measured on day 1; and the results showed that calves were not 
      deficient in these minerals. The TREAT group had greater BW gain during the final 
      third of the experiment. There was an increase in total leukocyte numbers as a 
      result of elevation in neutrophil counts (day 45) and monocytes (days 30 and 45) in 
      the TREAT group. This group also had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) content 
      (days 15, 30 and 45) and lipid peroxidation (LPO; days 15 and 45). Furthermore, the 
      TREAT group had greater antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP; days 15 
      and 30), activities of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx; days 15, 30 and 45) 
      and superoxide dismutase (SOD; day 15), concentrations of total serum proteins (day 
      30), serum globulin (days 15 and 30), ceruloplasmin (day 15), tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1, (IL-1; days 30 and 45) and interferon gamma 
      (IFNγ; day 45), compared to CON group. High respiratory rates during hot times of 
      the day in all study calves was suggestive of heat stress. Taken together, the data 
      suggest that mineral and vitamins injections increased the growth performance and 
      boosted the antioxidant and immunological systems of dairy calves during the diet 
      transition period in summer.

TI  - Partial and total defoliation during the filling period affected grain industrial 
      and nutraceutical quality in soybean.
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.11760 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about soybean grain chemical composition response to 
      defoliation. The objectives of our study were: (i) to quantify the impact of 
      different levels and timing of defoliation during the filling period on soybean 
      grain yield and grain chemical content and composition, including protein, oil, 
      fatty acids, and isoflavones; and (ii) to establish associations between them and 
      the level and timing of defoliation. RESULTS: Yield and grain chemical components 
      were reduced by defoliation treatments, these effects being more pronounced as 
      defoliation increased. Mild defoliation (33%) caused small or non-significant 
      changes in yield, its components, protein, oil, and isoflavone contents and 
      concentrations. However, it affected oil composition, increasing the degree of 
      unsaturation, which became more accentuated as defoliation increased. Moderate 
      defoliation (66%) produced similar relative reductions in protein and oil contents, 
      with small effects in isoflavone content, resulting in a generally greater 
      isoflavone concentration in defatted flour and a greater isoflavone/protein ratio in 
      grain. Total defoliation (100%) produced greater relative reductions in oil and 
      isoflavone contents than in protein content. These resulted in higher protein/oil 
      ratio and protein concentration and lower isoflavone/protein ratio and isoflavone 
      concentration. Analyzed variables were associated with cumulative solar radiation 
      during grain filling; indeed, this parameter successfully captured the effects of 
      defoliation intensity and timing. CONCLUSION: By exploring different levels and 
      timings of defoliation during the filling period, our study provides novel and 
      important information regarding the impact of light interception decreases on grain 
      chemical components, with special emphasis on nutraceuticals. © 2022 Society of

TI  - Polyphenols: a nutraceutical approach against diseases.
PG  - 214-9
AB  - Polyphenols are abundant in red grapes and in their derived products, amongst other 
      natural food sources. These compounds are associated with the prevention of diseases 
      caused by oxidative stress. The present review discusses the action of grape 
      polyphenols against diseases and the new polyphenol-rich products developed to be 
      used as nutraceuticals. Grape polyphenols demonstrated effects such as maintenance 
      of endothelial function, increase in antioxidant capacity and protection against LDL 
      oxidation. Recent patents regarding polyphenols show a tendency to use a 
      right-on-target approach and the new patented products are aiming at preventing and 
      treating specific diseases.

AB  - Pleurotus is an edible mushroom from the well-known genus of Basidiomycetes; it is 
      the second-most commonly consumed mushroom worldwide. This genus is characterized by 
      the presence of steroids, fatty acids, and polysaccharides. Recently, Pleurotus has 
      become popular as a functional food owing to its health benefits, primarily because 
      they are a source of vitamins, fibers, minerals, and lipids. In natural products 
      chemistry, dereplication techniques identify bioactive molecules from natural 
      sources such as plants and fungi without isolating or characterizing molecules. We 
      used dereplication techniques aided by the Global Natural Products Social Molecular 
      Network to analyze the chemical composition of the methanolic extracts of six 
      Pleurotus species (P. sapidus, P. ostreaus, P. ostreaus var. Florida, P. djamor, P. 
      citrinopileatus, and P. pulmonarius), to identify bioactive molecules with 
      nutraceutical properties. Using this technique, we identified several molecular 
      families, including eight fatty acids and seven steroids. Our findings suggest that 
      dereplication is a relatively rapid tool for characterizing fungal species and 
      determining their nutraceutical value.

AB  - Black rot of crucifers, (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris) is the principal 
      yield-limiting and destructive pathogen of cruciferous crop worldwide. In order to 
      validate a bio-based control alternative for this disease, whey, lime sulfur, 
      biofertilizer, Bordeaux mixture or raw milk were applied to kale (Brassica oleracea 
      var. acephala) plants. The disease control was achieved by most of the tested 
      products. Milk-based products (raw milk and whey) and biofertilizer reduced the 
      severity by 44 and 56% in the field. Antioxidants, crude fibber, crude protein and 
      lipid contents and kale yield were verified in the five treatments on the leaves 
      with and without X. campestris pv. campestris inoculation. In the absence of the 
      pathogen (non-inoculated), lime sulfur and Bordeaux mixture improved plant 
      nutritional value compared to organic treatments, nevertheless milk-based products 
      and biofertilizer improved the evaluated variables more than the control. However, 
      on leaves inoculated with X. campestris pv. campestris raw milk increased 
      antioxidant activity, crude protein and fiber contents, whereas biofertilizer 
      increased kale yield, lipid and antioxidant contents. Milk-based products and 
      biofertilizer were further evaluated in greenhouse trials to determinate 
      the activity of defense-related enzymes and lignin content. Biofertilizer treatment 
      resulted in increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase, catalase, peroxidase activities 
      and lignin content. Hence, the application of milk-based products and biofertilizer 
      are promising to control black rot of crucifers and also improves food quality by 
      boosting nutritional values and antioxidant activity.

TI  - Spray-Dried Structured Lipid Carriers for the Loading of Rosmarinus officinalis: New 
      Nutraceutical and Food Preservative.
LID - 10.3390/foods9081110 [doi]
LID - 1110
AB  - Rosemary, an aromatic herb with significant antioxidative activity, is frequently 
      used as food preservative and a source of nutraceuticals. Its antioxidant effect is 
      mainly related to the presence of phenolic compounds, molecules considerably 
      unstable and prone to irreversible physicochemical changes when exposed to external 
      agents. We here proposed the loading of rosemary into structured lipid systems to 
      improve its physicochemical properties. Four formulations were prepared using the 
      same amount of rosemary lyophilized extract. The lipid phase was composed of stearic 
      acid and oleic acid, and the aqueous phase, a varying combination of drying carriers 
      (whey protein concentrate or gum Arabic) and surfactant (Poloxamer 188). The 
      formulations were sonicated, spray-dried, and the obtained powders were 
      characterized regarding the density (0.18 g/mL to 0.26 g/mL), particle size 
      distribution (7 µm and 52 µm), and water solubility (29% to 48%). The antioxidant 
      activity was determined by applying ABTS(•+) radical-scavenging assay and the 
      results expressed per gram of lyophilized extract (150.6 μmol Trolox/g to 376.4 μmol 
      Trolox/g), with a significantly lower/higher result seen for formulations containing 
      gum Arabic and a higher concentration of Poloxamer. The prepared systems may have 
      potential applications as preservative in foodstuff and as nutraceutical.

LID - 10.3390/md15100251 [doi]
LID - 251
AB  - Padina sanctae-crucis Børgesen is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical 
      seas; belongs to the Dictyotaceae family, and has proven to be an exceptional source 
      of biologically active compounds. Four compounds were isolated and identified, 
      namely: dolastane diterpene new for the genus Padina; phaeophytin and 
      hidroxy-phaeophytin new for the family Dictyotaceae, and; mannitol first described 
      in this species. Saturated fatty acids as compared to the percentages of unsaturated 
      fatty acids were shown to be present in greater abundance. Palmitic and linolenic 
      acid were the main saturated and unsaturated acids, respectively. Cytotoxic and 
      antioxidant activities were evaluated using human erythrocytes. In vivo evaluations 
      of acute toxicity and genotoxicity were performed in mice. Methanolic extract of 
      P.sanctae-crucis presented antioxidant activity and did not induce cytotoxicity, 
      genotoxicity or acute toxicity. Since Padina sanctae-crucis is already used as food, 
      has essential fatty acids for the nutrition of mammals, does not present toxicity 
      and has antioxidant activity, it can be considered as a potential nutraceutical.

      non-treated (control), and treated (application of minerals) with three doses of 
      0.33 mL/kg of body weight mineral complex on days of life 1, 30, and 60. All animals 
      were weighed on day of life 1, 30, 60, 90, and 150. At the end of the experiment, 12 
      animals were slaughtered for physical and chemical analysis of meat, oxidant, and 
      antioxidant status, and for allometric analysis. Mineral-application animals had 
      greater live-weight (P < 0.05) on days of life 60 and 90. There was an increase in 
      fat thickness (P = 0.004); pH levels (P = 0.002) were lower in mineral-application 
      animal meat than in that of the control group. Meat was paler (according to 
      lightness (L color)) in the control group (P = 0.04). Weight loss from cooking was 
      greater in control animals (P = 0.004). Shear strength values were lower in the meat 
      of treated lambs (P = 0.008) suggesting that mineral application was associated with 
      increased meat tenderness. In addition, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities 
      were higher (P = 0.01) in mineral-treated animals, associated with a reduction in 
      reactive oxygen species levels (P < 0.01), and lipid peroxidation products 
      (P = 0.02). These data suggest that mineral application modulated oxidant and 
      antioxidant status, reflecting better meat quality.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is any effect resulting from preconditioning 
      with nutraceutical supplementation containing arginine and oil mixes with high ω9:ω6 
      ratio and low ω6:ω3 ratio containing EPA and DHA, ALA fatty acids on inflammatory 
      mediators, antioxidant and lipid profile modulation in surgical trauma. METHODS: 
      Twenty-six men scheduled for radical prostatectomy were randomized into three groups 
      and treated as follows: Group 1 (skim milk, 0% fat), Group 2 (supplement with ω6:ω3 
      ratio of 8:1 and arginine) and Group 3 (supplement with high ω9:ω6 ratio of 3.2:1 
      and low ω6:ω3 ratio of 1.4:1 and arginine). Patients received skin milk or 
      supplements twice a day (200 ml) during five days prior to surgery. Peripheral 
      venous blood samples were collected at three different timepoints: five days before 
      surgery (PRE), before anesthesia induction (IND) and on the 2nd postoperative day 
      (POS). Parameters analyzed included inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and 
      TNF-α), antioxidants (catalase), lipid profile and heat shock protein (HSP-27). 
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups on inflammatory 
      mediators and antioxidant parameters. However, lipid profile values (Cholesterol, 
      LDL, Triglycerides, VLDL), were significantly different. CONCLUSION: Preconditioning 
      with arginine and oil mixes containing high ω9:ω6 ratio and low ω6:ω3 ratio, has no 
      effects on inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress in patients undergoing 
      radical prostatectomy. Reduction of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and VLDL 
      profiles may be related to the trauma effect.

TI  - Pheophytinase Knockdown Impacts Carbon Metabolism and Nutraceutical Content Under 
      Normal Growth Conditions in Tomato.
PG  - 642-53
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcw021 [doi]
AB  - Although chlorophyll (Chl) degradation is an essential biochemical pathway for plant 
      physiology, our knowledge regarding this process still has unfilled gaps. 
      Pheophytinase (PPH) was shown to be essential for Chl breakdown in dark-induced 
      senescent leaves. However, the catalyzing enzymes involved in pigment turnover and 
      fruit ripening-associated degreening are still controversial. Chl metabolism is 
      closely linked to the biosynthesis of other isoprenoid-derived compounds, such as 
      carotenoids and tocopherols, which are also components of the photosynthetic 
      machinery. Chls, carotenoids and tocopherols share a common precursor, 
      geranylgeranyl diphosphate, produced by the plastidial methylerythritol 4-phosphate 
      (MEP) pathway. Additionally, the Chl degradation-derived phytol can be incorporated 
      into tocopherol biosynthesis. In this context, tomato turns out to be an interesting 
      model to address isoprenoid-metabolic cross-talk since fruit ripening combines 
      degreening and an intensely active MEP leading to carotenoid accumulation. Here, we 
      investigate the impact of PPH deficiency beyond senescence by the comprehensive 
      phenotyping of SlPPH-knockdown tomato plants. In leaves, photosynthetic parameters 
      indicate altered energy usage of excited Chl. As a mitigatory effect, 
      photosynthesis-associated carotenoids increased while tocopherol content remained 
      constant. Additionally, starch and soluble sugar profiles revealed a distinct 
      pattern of carbon allocation in leaves that suggests enhanced sucrose exportation. 
      The higher levels of carbohydrates in sink organs down-regulated carotenoid 
      biosynthesis. Additionally, the reduction in Chl-derived phytol recycling resulted 
      in decreased tocopherol content in transgenic ripe fruits. Summing up, tocopherol 
      and carotenoid metabolism, together with the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic 
      and hydrophobic fractions, were differentially affected in leaves and fruits of the 
      transgenic plants. Thus, in tomato, PPH plays a role beyond senescence-associated 
      Chl degradation that, when compromised, affects isoprenoid and carbon metabolism 
      which ultimately alters the fruit's nutraceutical content.

AB  - The cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis has been used by humans because of its 
      nutritional and possibly medicinal effects. Our study evaluated the influence of 
      temperature and nitrogen concentration in the medium on the production of biomass by 
      this cyanobacterium and the biomass composition in protein, lipid and phenolic 
      compounds. We found that at 35 degrees C there was a negative effect on biomass 
      production but a positive effect on the production of protein, lipids and phenolics, 
      the highest levels of these compounds being obtained in Zarrouk's medium containing 
      1.875 or 2.500 g l(-1) sodium nitrate. Higher biomass densities and productivity 
      were obtained at 30 degrees C than at 35 degrees C, but nitrogen concentration 
      appeared to have no effect on the amount of protein, lipid or phenolics, indicating 
      that at 30 degrees C the concentration of sodium nitrate in Zarrouk's medium (2.50 g 
      l(-1)) can be reduced without loss of productivity, an important cost-saving factor 
      in large-scale cultivation.

AB  - In recent years, the fruits of native Brazilian plant species with anti-inflammatory 
      property have gained prominence due to their properties comparable to traditional 
      medicines. This study aimed to chemically characterize and evaluate the 
      anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic activity of Byrsonima cydoniifolia fruit, 
      which is widely used to manufacture ice cream and jellies. Our results revealed that 
      the fruit exhibits flavonoid derivatives and stilbenes, as trans-piceatannol and 
      resveratrol, as main secondary metabolites. In mice, the hydroethanolic extract of 
      fruit reduced the edema, migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the 
      peritoneal cavity, as well as abdominal writhings. The results demonstrated, for the 
      first time, the presence of stilbenoids in the Byrsonima genus and the 
      anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic effect of Byrsonima cydoniifolia fruits, 
      supporting its potential as a nutraceutical food.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of nutraceuticals has become frequent in the cutaneous approach 
      to photoaging. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical efficacy of a nutraceutical 
      product composed of lycopene, acerola extract, grape seed extract and Biomarine 
      ComplexT in photoaged human skin. METHODS: 50 women, from 35 to 60 years of age, 
      phototypes I to III, were assessed. For 120 days, they associated the nutraceutical 
      product with the use of a sunscreen FPS15. On days 0 (D0), 30 (D30), 60 (D60), 90 
      (D90) and 120 (D120) they were evaluated and underwent Medical Assessments and 
      Self-Assessment and cutaneous biometric analyses (corneometry, sebumetry and 
      pH-metry) in the skin of the left zygomatic region and the upper medial side region 
      of the left arm; on days 0 (D0), 30 (D30) and 120 (D120) the skin of the same 
      regions was analyzed by ultrasound. On days 0 (D0) and 120 (D120) skin biopsies were 
      performed in the areas where instrumental evaluation was performed (to evaluate 
      collagen and elastic fibers). RESULTS: There was an improvement of the general 
      status of the skin of all volunteers by the Medical and Volunteer Self- Assessments; 
      increased parameters of cutaneous hydration, reduction of pH, increasing of 
      ultrasound density and a histological increment of collagen and elastic fibers (both 
      on the face and arm); there was a reduction of seborrhea (only on the face) 
      CONCLUSIONS: The daily use of a nutraceutical product containing lycopene, acerola 
      extract, grape seed extract and Biomarine ComplexT showed an important adjuvant 
      effect to counteract skin photoaging.

TI  - Lobularia maritima leave extract, a nutraceutical agent with antioxidant activity, 
      protects against CCl(4)-induced liver injury in mice.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/01480545.2020.1742730 [doi]
AB  - Lobularia maritima (Alyssum maritimum, Brassicaceae), commonly known as 
      sweet alyssum, is an annual ornamental halophyte widely spread along the Tunisian 
      seashore. Lobularia maritima leaf ethanol extract was tested in an experimental 
      model of hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). L. maritima 
      extract was found to possess in vitro antioxidant activity by scavenging the DPPH 
      radical (IC(50)= 45 μg/mL), reducing/chelating iron ions and inhibiting liver lipid 
      peroxidation induced by FeSO(4). The levels of total phenolics and flavonoids were 
      175 ± 2.66 mg GAE/g, and 35 ± 2.88 mg QE/g respectively. Moreover, HPLC analysis 
      revealed six compounds, namely gallic, salicylic, ellagic and ferulic acids as well 
      as catechin and quercetin. A mice model of acute liver injury was successfully 
      established after a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl(4), as evidenced by 
      histological analysis, Masson trichrome and Sirius red staining. Compared with the 
      CCl(4) intoxicated group, the L. maritima treatment resulted to reduce the liver 
      serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and increased the activities of antioxidant 
      enzymes with further amelioration in the oxidative stress. The present findings 
      discover the therapeutic potentials of L. maritima empowered with promising natural 
      leads for the treatment of oxidative stress associated health disorders by 
      attenuating free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and upregulating the 
      tissue-specific antioxidant enzymes.

TI  - Thermopressurized diluted phosphoric acid pretreatment of ligno(hemi)cellulose to 
      make free sugars and nutraceutical oligosaccharides.
PG  - 957-64
LID - 10.1007/s10295-014-1426-3 [doi]
AB  - Ligno(hemi)cellulosics (L(h)Cs) as sugarcane bagasse and loblolly pine sawdust are 
      currently being used to produce biofuels such as bioethanol and biobutanol through 
      fermentation of free sugars that are often obtained enzymatically. However, this 
      bioconversion requires a pretreatment to solubilize the hemicellulose fractions, 
      thus facilitating the action of the cellulolytic enzymes. Instead of the main free 
      monosaccharides used in these current models, the modulation of thermopressurized 
      orthophosphoric acid as a pretreatment, in the ranges of 3-12 atm and pH 1.5-2.5, 
      can produce nondigestible oligosaccharides (NDOS) such as xylo-oligosaccharides 
      (XOS) because heteroxylan is present in both types of hardwood and softwood 
      hemicelluloses. A comparative thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the hydrolytic 
      products showed the best conditions for NDOS production to be 7 atm/water, pH 2.25 
      and 2.50, and 8.5 atm/water for both sources. Particular hydrolysates from 7 atm 
      (171 °C) at pHs 2.25 and 2.50 both for cane bagasse and pine sawdust, with 
      respective oligosaccharide contents of 57 and 59 %, once mixed in a proportion of 
      1:1 for each plant source, were used in vitro as carbon sources for Bifidobacterium 
      or Lactobacillus. Once both bacteria attained the stationary phase of growth, an 
      unforeseen feature emerged: the preference of B. animalis for bagasse hydrolysates 
      and, conversely, the preference of L. casei for pine hydrolysates. Considering the 
      fact that nutraceutical oligosaccharides from both hemicelluloses correspond to 
      higher value-added byproducts, the technology using a much diluted thermopressurized 
      orthophosphoric acid pretreatment becomes an attractive choice for L(h)Cs.

AB  - Peanut samples were irradiated (0.0, 5.2, 7.2 or 10.0 kGy), stored for a year (room 
      temperature) and examined every three months. Mycotoxic fungi (MF) were detected in 
      non-irradiated blanched peanuts. A dose of 5.2 kGy was found suitable to prevent MF 
      growth in blanched samples. No MF was detected in in-shell peanuts, with or without 
      irradiation. The colors of the control in-shell and blanched samples were, 
      respectively, 44.72 and 60.21 (L *); 25.20 and 20.38 (Chroma); 53.05 and 86.46 
      (°Hue). The water activities (Aw) were 0.673 and 0.425. The corresponding fatty 
      acids were 13.33% and 12.14% (C16:0), 44.94% and 44.92% (C18:1, ω9) and 37.10% and 
      37.63% (C18:2, ω6). The total phenolics (TP) were 4.62 and 2.52 mg GAE/g, with 
      antioxidant activities (AA) of 16.97 and 10.36 μmol TEAC/g. Storage time negatively 
      correlated with Aw (in-shell peanuts) or L *, linoleic acid, TP and AA (in-shell and 
      blanched peanuts) but positively correlated with Aw (blanched peanuts), and with 
      oleic acid (in-shell and blanched peanuts). Irradiation positively correlated with 
      antioxidant activity (blanched peanuts). No correlation was found between 
      irradiation and AA (in-shell samples) or fatty acids and TP (in-shell and blanched 
      peanuts). Irradiation protected against MF and retained both the polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids and polyphenols in the samples.

AB  - The post-harvest nutraceutical characteristics of highly perishable native fruits 
      species from the Northern Brazilian Amazon region were studied during 12 day at 15 ± 
      1 °C and 95 ± 3% RH. Uxi and caja fruit showed climacteric behaviour while caju, 
      açai de terra firme, camu-camu, inajá, murici and araçá-boi were non-climacteric. 
      Soluble solids and sugars increased for climacteric fruit while total acidity 
      remained constant for all fruits. In general, all fruit species had high levels of 
      total phenolics (121-9889 mg GAE 100 g(-1) dry weight pulp), vitamin C (31-1532 mg 
      AA 100 mL(-1) juice) and antioxidant activity (AOX) (75-288 1 μmol Trolox Eq 100 
      g(-1) dry weight, ORAC value), however, camu-camu, acai and murici were among the 
      highest. All fruits showed an increase in phenolic content (15-82%), a simultaneous 
      decrease in ascorbic acid in both peel (88-98%) and pulp (89-97%), while AOX 
      increased or decreased depending on the fruit species, very likely due to the 
      specific phenolic profile being synthesized. We propose a hypothetical model where 
      ripening/senescence induced a redox homeostasis imbalance which in turn triggered 
      the responses.

TI  - Fast determination of four polar contaminants in soy nutraceutical products by 
      liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 8089-8098
AB  - An analytical method based on a modified QuPPe (quick polar pesticide) extraction 
      procedure coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was 
      evaluated for the determination of four polar compounds (chlorate, fosetyl-Al, 
      maleic hydrazide, and perchlorate) in nutraceutical products obtained from soy. 
      Experimental conditions including extraction such as solvent, acidification, time, 
      and clean-up sorbents were varied. Acidified acetonitrile (1 % formic acid, v/v) was 
      used as extraction solvent instead of methanol (conventional QuPPe), which provides 
      a doughy mixture which cannot be injected into the LC. Clean-up or derivatization 
      steps were avoided. For analysis, several stationary phases were evaluated and 
      Hypercarb (porous graphitic carbon) provided the best results. The optimized method 
      was validated and recoveries ranged between 46 and 119 %, and correction factors can 
      be used for quantification purposes bearing in mind that inter-day precision was 
      equal to or lower than 17 %. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 4 to 
      100 μg kg(-1). Soy-based nutraceutical products were analyzed and chlorate was 
      detected in five samples at concentrations between 63 and 1642 μg kg(-1). Graphical 
      Abstract Analysis of polar compounds in soy-based nutraceutical products.

TI  - Development of an innovative nutraceutical fermented beverage from herbal mate (Ilex 
      paraguariensis A.St.-Hil.) extract.
PG  - 788-800
LID - 10.3390/ijms13010788 [doi]
AB  - Herbal mate (Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil.) leaves are traditionally used for their 
      stimulant, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and diuretic activity, presenting as 
      principal components polyphenolic compounds. The aim of this work was to develop an 
      innovative, non-dairy, functional, probiotic, fermented beverage using herbal mate 
      extract as a natural ingredient which would also be hypocholesterolemic and 
      hepatoprotective. Among different strains used, Lactobacillus acidophilus was 
      selected as the best for fermentation. The addition of honey positively affected the 
      development of L. acidophilus and the formulated beverage maintained microbial 
      stability during shelf life. Key ingredients in the extract included xanthines, 
      polyphenols and other antioxidants with potential health benefits for the consumer. 
      Caffeine levels and antioxidant activity were also studied. Acceptable levels of 
      caffeine and large antioxidant capacity were observed for the formulation when 
      compared to other antioxidant beverages. An advantage of this product is the 
      compliance to organic claims, while providing caffeine, other phyto-stimulants and 
      antioxidant compounds without the addition of synthetic components or preservatives 
      in the formulation. Sensorial analysis demonstrated that the beverage had good 
      consumer acceptance in comparison to two other similar commercial beverages. 
      Therefore, this beverage could be used as a new, non-dairy vehicle for probiotic 
      consumption, especially by vegetarians and lactose intolerant consumers. It is 
      expected that such a product will have good market potential in an era of functional 
      foods.

TI  - Oxidative stress parameters in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy and treated with nutraceutical doses of oral glutamine.
PG  - 82-7
LID - S0102-86502011000700017 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of oral administration of GLN on the oxidative 
      stress in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant FAC chemotherapy (5 
      fluouracil 500 mg/m²+Doxorubicin 50 mg/m²+Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² body surface 
      area). METHODS: Twenty women (mean age: 51.7 years) with breast ductal carcinomas 
      classified as T3 or T4 were included in the study, regardless of pre or post 
      menopause status. Sachets containing glutamine 15g ("A") or milk protein 15g ("B") 
      were prepared by a registered pharmacist. Allocation of patients was made by 
      software program. Patients who received sachets labeled "A" were included in G1 
      group. The remaining patients, treated with the preparation labeled "B", were 
      included in group G2. Sachets contents were blended in 150 ml of drinking water, and 
      were given daily to each patient during the entire course of neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy. Peripheral blood samples were collected in the first day of each of 
      the three cycles of chemotherapy before drug infusion. Tumor and normal breast 
      samples were collected at the end of Patey´s surgical procedure. Samples were 
      analysed for GSH and TBARS contents. RESULTS: TBARS and GSH values were not 
      different in breast healthy and tumor tissues nor blood when comparing control (G-2) 
      and glutamine-treated (G-1) patients. Also, no significant differences were found in 
      TBARS and GSH levels comparing different timepoints within the same group. 
      CONCLUSION: Oral GLN (15g/kg/day) offers no protection against systemic or local 
      oxidative stress in women with breast Ca undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FAC).
