TI  - Nutraceutical or Pharmacological Potential of Moringa oleifera Lam.
LID - 10.3390/nu10030343 [doi]
LID - 343
AB  - Moringa oleifera Lam. (M. oleifera), which belongs to the Moringaceae family, is a 
      perennial deciduous tropical tree, and native to the south of the Himalayan 
      Mountains in northern India. M. oleifera is rich in proteins, vitamin A, minerals, 
      essential amino acids, antioxidants, and flavonoids, as well as isothiocyanates. The 
      extracts from M. oleifera exhibit multiple nutraceutical or pharmacological 
      functions including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, 
      neuroprotective, hypoglycemic, and blood lipid-reducing functions. The beneficial 
      functions of M. oleifera are strongly associated with its phytochemicals such as 
      flavonoids or isothiocyanates with bioactivity. In this review, we summarize the 
      research progress related to the bioactivity and pharmacological mechanisms of M. 
      oleifera in the prevention and treatment of a series of chronic diseases-including 
      inflammatory diseases, neuro-dysfunctional diseases, diabetes, and cancers-which 
      will provide a reference for its potential application in the prevention and 
      treatment of chronic diseases or health promotion.

TI  - Marine Bioactive Compounds as Nutraceutical and Functional Food Ingredients for 
      Potential Oral Health.
PG  - 686663

LID - 686663
AB  - Oral diseases have received considerable attention worldwide as one of the major 
      global public health problems. The development of oral diseases is influenced by 
      socioeconomic, physiological, traumatic, biological, dietary and hygienic practices 
      factors. Currently, the main prevention strategy for oral diseases is to inhibit the 
      growth of biofilm-producing plaque bacteria. Tooth brushing is the most common 
      method of cleaning plaque, aided by mouthwash and sugar-free chewing gum in the 
      daily routine. As the global nutraceutical market grows, marine bioactive compounds 
      are becoming increasingly popular among consumers for their antibacterial, 
      anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. However, to date, few systematic 
      summaries and studies on the application of marine bioactive compounds in oral 
      health exist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of different 
      marine-sourced bioactive compounds and their health benefits in dental caries, 
      gingivitis, periodontitis, halitosis, oral cancer, and their potential use as 
      functional food ingredients for oral health. In addition, limitations and challenges 
      of the application of these active ingredients are discussed and some observations 
      on current work and future trends are presented in the conclusion section.

TI  - Comparison of Nutritional and Nutraceutical Properties of Burdock Roots Cultivated 
      in Fengxian and Peixian of China.
LID - 10.3390/foods10092095 [doi]
LID - 2095
AB  - This study aimed to analyze and compare the nutritional quality of powders of 
      burdock root from Fengxian (FX) and Peixian (PX) in China. The nutrient composition 
      including carbohydrates, protein, amino acids, vitamin C, carotenoids, as well as 
      total phenols, total flavonoids and phenolic compounds were investigated in addition 
      to in vitro antioxidant capacity. The results showed that the basic nutrients of 
      burdock root powder (BRP) in both locations did not have significant differences (p 
      > 0.05), although the in vitro antioxidant capacity of BRP of Fengxian (F-BRP) was 
      greater than that of PX (p < 0.05). The burdock root peel powder (BRPP) possessed 
      more phenolics and stronger in vitro antioxidant capacity than the burdock root 
      powder (BRP) and peeled burdock root powder (PBRP) (p < 0.05). Moreover, better 
      quality burdock root was obtained from FX. F-BRP was consequently analyzed by 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for its phenolic 
      composition. Seventeen phenolics, mainly caffeoylquinic acids, were detected. In 
      addition, a total of 181 volatile compounds belonging to eight types were detected 
      including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes, esters, acids, linear or aromatic 
      hydrocarbons, and others. The diverse compounds found in this study can provide a 
      theoretical basis for the development and utilization of burdock in the food 
      industry.

TI  - Potential nutraceutical and food additive properties and risks of coffee: a 
      comprehensive overview.
PG  - 3293-3319
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2018.1489368 [doi]
AB  - Coffee is a composite mixture of more than a thousand diverse phytochemicals like 
      alkaloids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals and 
      nitrogenous compounds. Coffee has multifunctional properties as a food additive and 
      nutraceutical. As a nutraceutical, coffee has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, 
      antidyslipidemic, anti-obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVD), which can serve for the treatment and prevention of metabolic 
      syndrome and associated disorders. On the other hand, as a food additive, coffee has 
      antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, inhibits lipid 
      peroxidation (LPO), and can function as a prebiotic. The outcomes of different 
      studies also revealed that coffee intake may reduce the incidence of numerous 
      chronic diseases, like liver disease, mental health, and it also overcomes the 
      all-cause mortality, and suicidal risks. In some studies, high intake of coffee is 
      linked to increase CVD risk factors, like cholesterol, plasma homocysteine and blood 
      pressure (BP). There is also a little evidence that associated the coffee 
      consumption with increased risk of lung tumors in smokers. Among adults who consume 
      the moderate amount of coffee, there is slight indication of health hazards with 
      strong indicators of health benefits. Moreover, existing literature suggests that it 
      may be cautious for pregnant women to eliminate the chances of miscarriages and 
      impaired fetal growth. The primary purpose of this narrative review is to provide an 
      overview of the findings of the positive impacts and risks of coffee consumption on 
      human health. In conclusion, to date, the best available evidence from research 
      indicates that drinking coffee up to 3-4 cups/day provides health benefits for most 
      people.

LID - 2417410
AB  - Sargassum fulvellum is a brown seaweed of the Sargassaceae family which has been 
      demonstrated to exhibit antipyretic, analgesic, antiedema, antimicrobial, 
      antioxidant, antitumor, neuroprotective, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory, and 
      hepatoprotective activities. It has been widely used as a food additive and as a 
      medicine in oriental medicine to treat lumps, dropsy, swelling, testicular pains, 
      and urinary problems. S. fulvellum has been identified as a potential producer of a 
      wide spectrum of natural compounds such as carotenoids, fucoidans, and 
      phlorotannins, showing different biological activities in various industrial 
      applications including pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and functional 
      food. However, the promising health effects associated with the extracts and 
      compounds isolated from S. fulvellum have not been reviewed to date. The present 
      review thus focuses on the biological activity of S. fulvellum as reported by 
      previous publications, which include antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, 
      neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer effects. Thus, this 
      review might serve to increase the utilization of this invaluable natural source as 
      a potential component in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.

AB  - Onion (Allium cepa L) is a major reservoir of important nutraceutical ingredients. 
      Herein, nutraceutical profiling of elite germplasm was assessed and hybrids with 
      improved nutraceutical quality were selected. The nutraceutical components were 
      screened through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis (scan range 
      4000-400cm-1) followed by spectrophotometric/colorimetric quantification in oven 
      dried bulb samples. Line Ã Tester (LÃT) analysis was used to identify potential 
      hybrids with better nutraceutical quality. Based on common functional groups 
      obtained from FTIR analysis, as well as bulb color, the onion genotypes were 
      categorized into six groups viz., white, yellowish brown, light brown, dark brown, 
      brown and purplish brown. Results indicated that the purplish brown, yellowish brown 
      and dark brown genotypes had maximum concentration of pyruvic acid, total flavonoids 
      and total phenolic content, while vitamin C content showed weak association with 
      color pigmentation. The onion variety 'Onion Swat' contained the highest level of 
      pyruvic acid (17.18 Î¼M) and 'MKS8823GO' had the highest vitamin C content 
      (13.83mg/100mL). The LÃT analysis revealed that out of 35 crosses, 'MKS-77127 Ã 
      Onion Swat' and 'MKS-77127 Ã MKS777' were the best hybrids with improved 
      nutraceutical quality. Further, observations for specific combining ability, general 
      combining ability, genetic versus environmental variance, heritability and heterosis 
      indicated that the studied parameters were genetically inherited and could be 
      improved significantly by adopting an appropriate breeding strategy.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential for cellular physiological 
      processes, directly or indirectly affecting metabolism and gene expression. The 
      decline of NAD(+) levels in the heart is accompanied by aging, causing cardiac 
      pathological remodeling and dysfunction. Niacinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has 
      emerged as a precursor to alleviate age-related cardiac pathophysiological changes 
      by improving cardiac NAD(+) homeostasis. Preclinical trials on the efficacy and 
      safety of intaking NMN have shown encouraging results, revealing a cardioprotective 
      effect without significant side effects. Strategies for improving the effectiveness 
      of NMN are also evolving. The present review aimed to summarize the potentials of 
      NMN as a nutraceutical against cardiac agingÂ and highlight the relationship between 
      NMN supplementation and cardiac protection.

LID - 10.1002/fsn3.1835 [doi]
AB  - Sargassum fusiforme, also known as Yangqicai () in Chinese and Hijiki in Japanese, 
      is a brown seaweed that grows abundantly along the rocky coastlines of Asian 
      countries such as Japan, Korea, and China. The first use of S.Â fusiforme as a 
      traditional Chinese medicinal plant was recorded in the Shennong Bencao Jing, dated 
      200 AD. It was referred to as Haizao (seaweed), renowned for treating Yinglu 
      (tumor-like induration), dysuria, and edema. Currently, it is commonly used in 
      traditional cuisine as it is rich in dietary fiber and minerals such as calcium, 
      iron, and magnesium. Owing to its health benefits, S.Â fusiforme remains popular in 
      China, Korea, and Japan, as well as in the UK and in North America. Currently, there 
      is a lack of research on S.Â fusiforme; thus, we review the therapeutic effects of 
      S.Â fusiforme, such as anticancer, antiangiogenic, and antiviral effects, in vitro 
      and in vivo as reported during the past two decades. This review may promote further 
      research on the therapeutic uses of S.Â fusiforme. Furthermore, we discuss the 
      processes and considerations involved in using drugs produced from marine sources.

TI  - Nutraceutical Compounds Targeting Inflammasomes in Human Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21144829 [doi]
LID - 4829
AB  - The macromolecular complex known as "inflammasome" is defined as an intracellular 
      multi-protein complex composed of a sensor receptor (PRR), an adaptor protein and an 
      effector enzyme (caspase-1), which oligomerize when they sense danger, such as how 
      the NLR family, AIM-2 and RIG-1 receptors protect the body against danger via 
      cytokine secretion. Within the NLR members, NLRP3 is the most widely known and 
      studied inflammasome and has been linked to many diseases. Nowadays, people's 
      interest in their lifestyles and nutritional habits is increasing, mainly due to the 
      large number of diseases that seem to be related to both. The term "nutraceutical" 
      has recently emerged as a hybrid term between "nutrition" and "pharmacological" and 
      it refers to a wide range of bioactive compounds contained in food with relevant 
      effects on human health. The relationship between these compounds and diseases based 
      on inflammatory processes has been widely exposed and the compounds stand out as an 
      alternative to the pathological consequences that inflammatory processes may have, 
      beyond their defense and repair action. Against this backdrop, here we review the 
      results of studies using several nutraceutical compounds in common diseases 
      associated with the inflammation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes complex. 
      In general, it was found that there is a wide range of nutraceuticals with effects 
      through different molecular pathways that affect the activation of the inflammasome 
      complex, with positive effects mainly in cardiovascular, neurological diseases, 
      cancer and type 2 diabetes.

      review.
PG  - e13228
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.13228 [doi]
AB  - Phalsa (Grewia asiatica L.) is a food plant originating from Southeast Asia, and is 
      cultivated primarily for its fruit. Phalsa fruit is consumed raw or used as a drink 
      or food additive. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies have found that 
      extracts from various parts of phalsa plants (especially the fruit) possess strong 
      antioxidant, radioprotective, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
      anticancer, and cardio-protective properties. However, despite the identification of 
      numerous nutritional and health benefits of phalsa, research into nutraceutical 
      applications of the plant are somewhat limited. Therefore, the objective of this 
      review was to explore the pharmacological, nutritional, phytochemical, and other 
      potential uses of the phalsa plant. Recommendations for food scientists, 
      nutritionists, and members of other allied disciplines are provided to help direct 
      future research into the production, value addition, preservation, and phytochemical 
      characterization of phalsa. Moreover, its potential health benefits are highlighted, 
      along with the underlying mechanisms of action. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The aim of 
      the present review is to explore functional aspects of phalsa (Grewia asiatica L.) 
      bioactive compounds, their role in improving health, as well as their possible 
      application as a functional food ingredient.

      biocompatibility. The associated unique physical and chemical properties have made 
      these nanomaterials an intriguing prospect for various applications including the 
      food and nutraceutical industry. From the immobilization of various bioactive agents 
      and enzymes, emulsion stabilization, direct food additives, to the development of 
      intelligent packaging systems or pathogen or pH detectors, the potential food 
      related applications for CNMs are endless. Over the past decade, there have been 
      several reviews published covering different aspects of cellulosic nanomaterials, 
      such as processing-structure-property relationship, physical and chemical 
      properties, rheology, extraction, nanocomposites, etc. In this critical review, we 
      have discussed and provided a summary of the recent developments in the utilization 
      of cellulosic nanomaterials in applications related to food and nutraceuticals.

AB  - Osmanthus fragrans (Thunb.) Lour. has been cultivated in China for over 2500Â years. 
      Due to the unique and strong fragrance, O. fragrans flowers have long been added 
      into food, tea, and beverages. Not only the O. fragrans flowers, but also leaves, 
      barks, roots, and fruits possess some beneficial effects such as relieving pain and 
      alleviating cough in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Modern pharmacological researches 
      demonstrated that O. fragrans possesses a broad spectrum of biological activities 
      including antioxidant, neuroprotective, antidiabetic and anticancer activities etc. 
      A large number of phytochemicals identified in O. fragrans are responsible for its 
      health promoting and disease preventing effects. The components of volatile 
      compounds in O. fragrans are complex but the content is less abundant. The present 
      review mainly focuses on the bioactive ingredients identified from O. fragrans, the 
      therapeutic effects of O. fragrans and its applications in food, cosmetics and 
      medicines.

AB  - Several theories for aging are constantly put forth to explain the underlying 
      mechanisms. Oxidative stress, DNA dysfunction, inflammation, and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, along with the release of cytochrome c are some of these theories. 
      Diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, intestinal dysfunction, cardiovascular 
      diseases, hepatic injury, and even cancer develop with age and eventually cause 
      death. Ulva polysaccharides, owing to their special structures and various 
      functions, have emerged as desirable materials for keeping healthy. These 
      polysaccharide structures are found to be closely related to the extraction methods, 
      seaweed strains, and culture conditions. Ulvan is a promising bioactive substance, a 
      potential functional food, which can regulate immune cells to augment inflammation, 
      control the activity of aging-related genes, promote tumor senescence, enhance 
      mitochondrial function, maintain liver balance, and protect the gut microbiome from 
      inflammatory attacks. Given the desirable physiochemical and gelling properties of 
      ulvan, it would serve to improve the quality and shelf-life of food.

TI  - Macrofungi as a Nutraceutical Source: Promising Bioactive Compounds and Market 
      Value.
LID - 10.3390/jof7050397 [doi]
LID - 397
AB  - Macrofungi production and economic value have been increasing globally. The demand 
      for macrofungi has expanded rapidly owing to their popularity among consumers, 
      pleasant taste, and unique flavors. The presence of high quality proteins, 
      polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, triterpene sterols, and 
      secondary metabolites makes macrofungi an important commodity. Macrofungi are well 
      known for their ability to protect from or cure various health problems, such as 
      immunodeficiency, cancer, inflammation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. Many studies have demonstrated their medicinal 
      properties, supported by both in vivo and in vitro experimental studies, as well as 
      clinical trials. Numerous bioactive compounds isolated from mushrooms, such as 
      polysaccharides, proteins, fats, phenolic compounds, and vitamins, possess strong 
      bioactivities. Consequently, they can be considered as an important source of 
      nutraceuticals. Numerous edible mushrooms have been studied for their bioactivities, 
      but only a few species have made it to the market. Many species remain to be 
      explored. The converging trends and popularity of eastern herbal medicines, 
      natural/organic food product preference, gut-healthy products, and positive outlook 
      towards sports nutrition are supporting the growth in the medicinal mushroom market. 
      The consumption of medicinal mushrooms as functional food or dietary supplement is 
      expected to markedly increase in the future. The global medicinal mushroom market 
      size is projected to increase by USD 13.88 billion from 2018 to 2022. The global 
      market values of promising bioactive compounds, such as lentinan and lovastatin, are 
      also expected to rise. With such a market growth, mushroom nutraceuticals hold to be 
      very promising in the years to come.

AB  - Fucoxanthin (Fx), a major carotenoid found in brown seaweed, is known to show a 
      unique and wide variety of biological activities. Upon absorption, Fx is metabolized 
      to fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin, and these metabolites mainly accumulate in 
      visceral white adipose tissue (WAT). As seen in other carotenoids, Fx can quench 
      singlet oxygen and scavenge a wide range of free radicals. The antioxidant activity 
      is related to the neuroprotective, photoprotective, and hepatoprotective effects of 
      Fx. Fx is also reported to show anti-cancer activity through the regulation of 
      several biomolecules and signaling pathways that are involved in either cell cycle 
      arrest, apoptosis, or metastasis suppression. Among the biological activities of Fx, 
      anti-obesity is the most well-studied and most promising effect. This effect is 
      primarily based on the upregulation of thermogenesis by uncoupling protein 1 
      expression and the increase in the metabolic rate induced by mitochondrial 
      activation. In addition, Fx shows anti-diabetic effects by improving insulin 
      resistance and promoting glucose utilization in skeletal muscle.

TI  - Nutraceutical Study on Maianthemum atropurpureum, a Wild Medicinal Food Plant in 
      Northwest Yunnan, China.

AB  - Maianthemum atropurpureum (Franch) LaFrankie (Asparagaceae), called nibai in Tibetan 
      or dongka in Drung or zhu-ye-cai in local Chinese, is a wild vegetable consumed by 
      the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in Northwest Yunnan, China. It is also a 
      traditional medicinal plant used by different linguistic groups for antimicrobial 
      purposes. However the nutritional and phytochemical compositions of this important 
      medicinal food plant have not been well studied previously. In this study, the 
      nutrient content for nibai was determined by the China National Standards (GB) 
      methods, and the phytochemical analysis involved multiple chromatographic and 
      spectral methods including LC-TOF-MS analysis. Dried nibai is a rich source of 
      protein (ca. 24.6%), with 18 of the 21 common amino acids. The amino acid content of 
      nibai can reach up to 17.9/100Â g, with the essential amino acids as major 
      contributors, corresponding to 42.3% of the total amino acids. Nibai contains rich 
      mineral elements, dietary fiber, vitamins, Î²-carotene, carbohydrates, and lipids. 
      The phytochemical content of nibai was examined by conventional isolation 
      strategies, as well as HR-ESI-TOF-MS to detect and identify 16 compounds including 
      nine steroid saponins and seven flavonoids. Among these compounds, uridine, 
      adenosine, guanosine, and Î²-methyl-6-methyl-d-glucopyranoside were found from the 
      genus Maianthemum for the first time. These results help to demonstrate that the 
      local people's practice of consuming Maianthemum atropurpureum is reasonable due to 
      its high levels of vitamins, minerals, essential amino-acids, and phytochemicals. 
      Nibai may be further developed in Tibet and surrounding regions, and beyond as a 
      health food, nutraceutical, and/or dietary supplement product.

AB  - Buckwheat (Fagopyrum spp.) under the family Polygonaceae is an ancient pseudocereal 
      with stupendous but less studied nutraceutical properties. The gluten free nature of 
      protein, balanced amino acid profile and health promoting bioactive flavonoids make 
      it a golden crop of future. Besides a scanty basic research, not much attention has 
      been paid to the improvement of plant type and breeding of nutraceutical traits. 
      Scanning of scientific literature indicates that adequate genetic variation exists 
      for agronomic and nutritional traits in mainstream and wild gene pool of buckwheat. 
      However, the currently employed conventional approaches together with poorly 
      understood genetic mechanisms restrict effective utilization of the existing genetic 
      variation in nutraceutical breeding of buckwheat. The latest trends in buckwheat 
      genomics, particularly avalilabity of draft genome sequences for both the cultivated 
      species (F. esculentum and F.tataricum) hold immense potential to overcome these 
      limitations. Utilizing the transgenic hairy rot cultures, role of various 
      transcription factors and gene families have been deduced in production and 
      biosynthesis of bioactive flavonoids. Further, the acquisition of high-density 
      genomics data coupled with the next-generation phenotyping will certainly improve 
      our understanding of underlying genetic regulation of nutraceutical traits. The 
      present paper highlights the application of multilayered omics interventions for 
      tailoring a nutrient rich buckwheat cultivar and nutraceutical product development.

AB  - Proanthocyanidins are among the most abundant constituents in pine bark extracts 
      (PBEs). This review summarizes medical research on PBEs from Pinus pinaster, Pinus 
      radiata, Pinus massoniana, and other less well characterized species. The precise 
      mechanisms of the important physiologic functions of PBE components remain to be 
      elucidated, but there is evidently great potential for the identification and 
      development of novel antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, 
      neuroprotective, and anticancer medicines. Although toxicological data for PBEs are 
      limited, no serious adverse effects have been reported. PBEs, therefore, may have 
      potential as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and should be safe for use as food 
      ingredients.

TI  - From nutraceutical to clinical trial: frontiers in Ganoderma development.
PG  - 9037-9051
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9326-5 [doi]
AB  - Ganoderma spp. are medical mushrooms with various pharmacological compounds which 
      are regarded as a nutraceutical for improving health and treating diseases. This 
      review summarizes current progress in the studies of Gamoderma ranging from 
      bioactive metabolites, bioactivities, production techniques to clinical trials. 
      Traditionally, polysaccharides and ganoderic acids have been reported as the major 
      bioactive metabolites of Ganoderma possessing anti-tumor and immunomodulation 
      functions. Moreover, recent studies indicate that Gandoerma also exerts other 
      bioactivities such as skin lighting, gut microbiota regulation, and anti-virus 
      effects. However, since these medical fungi are rare in natural environment, and 
      that the cost of cultivation of fruiting bodies is high, industrial submerged 
      fermentation of Ganoderma mycelia promotes the development of Ganoderma by dint of 
      an increase of biomass and bioactive metabolites used for further application. In 
      addition, various strategies for production of different metabolites are well 
      developed, such as gene regulation, bi-stage pH, and oxygen control. To date, 
      Ganoderma not only has become one of the most popular nutraceuticals worldwide but 
      also has been applied to clinical trials for advanced diseases such as breast and 
      non-small-cell lung cancer.

TI  - Flavonoid-rich foods (FRF): A promising nutraceutical approach against 
      lifespan-shortening diseases.
PG  - 140-153
LID - 10.22038/IJBMS.2019.35125.8353 [doi]
AB  - It is well documented that life expectancy in developed countries at birth is going 
      to surpass the 20(th) century. However, regrettably, a potential decline in life 
      expectancy has been proposed for these nations in the 21st century due to a rapid 
      upsurge in the prevalence of fatal degenerative diseases like cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVD), cancer and diabetes. Collectively, these three diseases accounted 
      for 65% of all deaths in urbanized societies and were considered as a dynamic issue 
      for shortening the genetically determined lifespan through increased mortalities, 
      morbidities, disabilities, immense sufferings, and premature aging. These fatal 
      degenerative diseases and premature aging are closely associated with oxidative 
      stress produced by the free radicals in the body. In epidemiologic studies, 
      flavonoid-rich foods (FRF) like fruits, vegetables, and beverages have been 
      associated as protective agents against these diseases. These also have been 
      observed for their geroprotective effects and help in preventing premature aging and 
      deterioration of brain function, which is related to Alzheimer's disease and 
      dementia. In this review, we presented a comprehensive overview of the FRF for their 
      potential role against lifespan-shortening complications, i.e., CVD, cancer, and 
      diabetes. We also have drawn the future perspective and dietary guidelines to reduce 
      the fatal disease burden in urban populations.

TI  - Herbal nutraceutical treatment of chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome: 
      a literature review.
PG  - 1515-1528
LID - 10.1007/s11255-021-02868-w [doi]
AB  - Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is the most frequent form 
      of prostatitis, and has a serious impact on patients' quality of life, and causes 
      severe symptoms. The pain in the pelvic, perineal and penile areas, lower abdominal 
      pain, and pain during urination or ejaculation are the main complaints of CP/CPPS. 
      The underlying complex and unknown pathophysiology of this syndrome have made the 
      management of CP/CPPS and the availability of monotherapy challenging. To identify 
      an effective monotherapy, a plethora of clinical trials failed due to its puzzling 
      etiology. Antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and a-blockers have been commonly used for 
      the treatment of CP/CPPS, but the desired and complete effects have not been gotten 
      yet. The patients and clinicians are attracted to alternative therapies because of 
      their multi-targeted effects. Attention toward natural compounds effectiveness and 
      safety, supporting the development of a new nutraceutical science. In the 
      alternative remedies for the treatment of prostatic diseases, medicinal herbs, in 
      the form of herb parts or extracts, are getting attention due to their positive 
      effects on prostatic diseases. At present, there is no available detailed literature 
      review about the efficacy of medicinal herbs in the treatment of CP/CPPS. This 
      review aimed to explore the useful medicinal herbs in the treatment of CP/CPPS from 
      different perspectives and their possible mechanism of action in managing CP/CPPS.

AB  - Diet sources are closely involved in the pathogenesis of diverse neuropsychiatric 
      disorders and cancers, in addition to inherited factors. Currently, natural products 
      or nutraceuticals (commonly called medical foods) are increasingly employed for 
      adjunctive therapy of these patients. However, the potential molecular mechanisms of 
      the nutrient efficacy remain elusive. In this review, we summarized the 
      neuroprotective and anti-cancer mechanisms of nutraceuticals. It was concluded that 
      the nutraceuticals exerted neuroprotection and suppressed tumor growth possibly 
      through the differential modulations of redox homeostasis. In addition, the balance 
      between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ROS elimination was manipulated 
      by multiple molecular mechanisms, including cell signaling pathways, inflammation, 
      transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modulation, which were involved in the 
      therapeutic potential of nutraceutical antioxidants against neurological diseases 
      and cancers. We specifically proposed that ROS scavenging was integral in the 
      neuroprotective potential of nutraceuticals, while alternation of ROS level (either 
      increase or decrease) or disruption of redox homeostasis (ROS addiction) constituted 
      the anti-cancer property of these compounds. We also hypothesized that 
      ROS-associated ferroptosis, a novel type of lipid ROS-dependent regulatory cell 
      death, was likely to be a critical mechanism for the nutraceutical antioxidants. 
      Targeting ferroptosis is advantageous to develop new nutraceuticals with more 
      effective and lower adverse reactions for curing patients with neuropsychiatric 
      diseases or carcinomas.

AB  - vitexin, an apigenin-8-C-glucoside, is widely present in numerous edible and 
      medicinal plants. vitexin possesses a variety of bioactive properties, including 
      antioxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, neuron-protection, and 
      cardio-protection. Other beneficial health effects, such as fat reduction, glucose 
      metabolism, and hepatoprotection, have also been reported in recent studies. This 
      review briefly discusses the absorption and metabolism of vitexin, as well as its 
      influence on gut microbiota. Recent advances in understanding the pharmacological 
      and biological effects of vitexin are then reviewed. Improved knowledge of the 
      absorption, metabolism, bioactivity, and molecular targets of vitexin is crucial for 
      the better utilization of this emerging nutraceutical as a chemopreventive and 
      chemotherapeutic agent.

TI  - Fucoxanthin activities motivate its nano/micro-encapsulation for food or 
      nutraceutical application: a review.
PG  - 9338-9358
LID - 10.1039/d0fo02176h [doi]
AB  - Fucoxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid abundant in marine brown algae. The 
      potential therapeutic effects of fucoxanthin on tumor intervention have been well 
      documented, which have aroused great interests in utilizing fucoxanthin in 
      functional foods and nutraceuticals. However, the utilization of fucoxanthin as a 
      nutraceutical in food and nutrient supplements is currently limited due to its low 
      water solubility, poor stability, and limited bioaccessibility. 
      Nano/micro-encapsulation is a technology that can overcome these challenges. A 
      systematic review on the recent progresses in nano/micro-delivery systems to 
      encapsulate fucoxanthin in foods or nutraceuticals is warranted. This article starts 
      with a brief introduction of fucoxanthin and the challenges of oral delivery of 
      fucoxanthin. Nano/micro-encapsulation technology is then covered, including 
      materials and strategies for constructing the delivery system. Finally, future 
      prospective has been discussed on properly designed oral delivery systems of 
      fucoxanthin for managing cancer. Natural edible materials such as whey protein, 
      casein, zein, gelatin, and starch have been successfully utilized to fabricate 
      lipid-based, gel-based, or emulsion-based delivery systems, molecular nanocomplexes, 
      and biopolymer nanoparticles with the aid of advanced processing techniques, such as 
      freeze-drying, high pressure homogenization, sonication, anti-solvent precipitation, 
      coacervation, ion crosslinking, ionic gelation, emulsification, and enzymatic 
      conjugation. These formulated nano/micro-capsules have proven to be effective in 
      stabilizing and enhancing the bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin. This review will 
      inspire a surge of multidisciplinary research in a broader community of foods and 
      motivate material scientists and researchers to focus on nano/micro-encapsulated 
      fucoxanthin in order to facilitate the commercialization of orally-deliverable tumor 
      intervention products.

AB  - Nutraceuticals are food substances with medical and health benefits for humans. 
      Limited by complicated procedures, high cost, low yield, insufficient raw materials, 
      resource waste, and environment pollution, chemical synthesis and extraction are 
      being replaced by microbial synthesis of nutraceuticals. Many microbial strains that 
      are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) have been identified and developed for the 
      synthesis of nutraceuticals, and significant nutraceutical production by these 
      strains has been achieved. In this review, we systematically summarize recent 
      advances in nutraceutical research in terms of physiological effects on health, 
      potential applications, drawbacks of traditional production processes, 
      characteristics of production strains, and progress in microbial fermentation. 
      Recent advances in systems and synthetic biology techniques have enabled 
      comprehensive understanding of GRAS strains and its wider applications. Thus, these 
      microbial strains are promising cell factories for the commercial production of 
      nutraceuticals.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Fate of Fluid and Gelled Nutraceutical Emulsions: Impact on 
      Proteolysis, Lipolysis, and Quercetin Bioaccessibility.
PG  - 9087-9096
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b03003 [doi]
AB  - Fluid and gelled nutraceutical emulsions were formulated from quercetin-loaded 
      caseinate-stabilized emulsions by the addition of gellan gum with or without 
      acidification with glucono-Î´-lactone. Gellan gum addition increased the viscosity or 
      gel strength of the fluid and gelled emulsions, respectively. The behavior of the 
      nutraceutical emulsions in a simulated gastrointestinal tract depended upon their 
      initial composition. Fluid emulsions containing different gellan gum levels (0-0.2%) 
      had similar protein and lipid hydrolysis rates as well as similar quercetin 
      bioaccessibility (â¼51%). Conversely, proteolysis, lipolysis, and quercetin 
      bioaccessibility decreased with an increasing gellan gum level in the gelled 
      emulsions. In comparison to gelled emulsions, fluid emulsions were digested more 
      rapidly and led to higher quercetin bioaccessibility. There was a good correlation 
      between quercetin bioaccessibility and the lipolysis rate. These findings are useful 
      for designing nutraceutical-loaded emulsions that can be used in a wide range of 
      food products with different rheological properties.

TI  - A Brief Review of Nutraceutical Ingredients in Gastrointestinal Disorders: Evidence 
      and Suggestions.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21051822 [doi]
LID - 1822
AB  - The dietary effect on gut health has long been recognized through the empirical 
      practice of soothing gastric discomfort with certain types of food, and recently the 
      correlation between specific diets with lower incidences of several gastrointestinal 
      diseases has been revealed. Ingredients from those considered beneficial foods have 
      been isolated and studied, and some of them have already been put into the 
      supplement market. In this review, we focus on latest studies of these food-derived 
      ingredients for their proposed preventive and therapeutic roles in gastrointestinal 
      disorders, with the attempt of drawing evidence-based suggestions on consuming these 
      products.

TI  - Exogenous application of melatonin to plants, algae, and harvested products to 
      sustain agricultural productivity and enhance nutritional and nutraceutical value: A 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - Melatonin is produced by plants, algae, and animals. Worldwide studies show diverse 
      positive effects of exogenous melatonin on plants, edible plant products, and algae, 
      but the potential of melatonin to enhance food and feed systems through these 
      positive effects remains largely unexplored. Through a meta-analysis of about 25,000 
      observations, we show for the first time that exogenous application of melatonin 
      significantly increases crop productivity and yields, and enhances the nutritional 
      and nutraceutical value of edible plant products and algae by regulating diverse 
      biological functions. We demonstrate that melatonin can improve plants, edible plant 
      products, and algae under various current climate change scenarios, environmental 
      pollution factors, and other stresses by about 7% to nearly 30%, on average, 
      depending on the stressor. We also analyze various technical/methodological factors 
      influencing the desired outcomes and identify conditions that offer optimal 
      enhancement. We show that the positive effect of melatonin on plants and edible 
      plant products varies among species, genera, and families, and strongly depends on 
      the concentration of melatonin and treatment duration. The effect of melatonin is 
      slightly lower on the monocot clade Commelinids than on the eudicot clades Asterids 
      and Rosids. We also show that its stimulatory effect on plants depends on 
      cultivation system, with a larger effect obtained in hydroponic systems. However, it 
      does not depend on application stage (seed or vegetative), application route 
      (foliage, roots, or seed), and whether the cultivation system is ex vivo or in vivo. 
      This is the first meta-analysis examining the effects of melatonin on plants, edible 
      plant products, and algae, and offers a scientific and technical roadmap 
      facilitating sustainable food and feed production through the application of 
      exogenous melatonin.

TI  - Nano-architectural assembly of soy proteins: A promising strategy to fabricate 
      nutraceutical nanovehicles.

AB  - Use of protein-based nanovehicles has been well recognized to be one of the most 
      effective strategies to improve water dispersibility, stability and bioavailability 
      of nutraceuticals or bioactive ingredients. Thanks to their health-benefiting 
      effects and unique assembly behavior, soy proteins seem to be the perfect food 
      proteins for fabricating nanovehicles in this regard. This review presents the 
      state-of-art knowledge about the assembly of soy proteins into nano-architectures, 
      e. g., nanoparticles, nanocomplexes or nanogels, induced by different 
      physicochemical strategies and approaches. The strategies to trigger the assembly of 
      soy proteins into a variety of nano-architectures are highlighted and critically 
      reviewed. Such strategies include heating, enzymatic hydrolysis, pH shift, urea or 
      ethanol treatment, reduction, and static high pressure treatment. The self-assembly 
      behavior of soy proteins (native or denatured) is also reviewed. Besides the 
      assembly of proteins alone, soy proteins can co-assemble with polysaccharides to 
      form versatile nano-architectures, through different processes, e.g., heating or 
      ultrasonication. Finally, recent progress in the development of assembled soy 
      protein nano-architectures as nanovehicles for hydrophobic nutraceuticals is briefly 
      summarized. With the fast increasing health awareness for natural and safe 
      functional foods, this review is of crucial relevance for providing an important 
      strategy to develop a kind of novel soy protein-based functional foods with 
      dual-function health effects from soy proteins and nutraceuticals.

TI  - Dietary biomolecules as promising regenerative agents for peripheral nerve injury: 
      An emerging nutraceutical-based therapeutic approach.
PG  - e13989
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.13989 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerve damage is a debilitating condition that can result in partial or 
      complete functional loss as a result of axonal degeneration, as well as lifelong 
      dependence. Many therapies have been imbued with a plethora of positive features 
      while posing little risks. It is worth noting that these biomolecules work by 
      activating several intrinsic pathways that are known to be important in peripheral 
      nerve regeneration. Although the underlying mechanism is used for accurate and 
      speedy functional recovery, none of them are without side effects. As a result, it 
      is believed that effective therapy is currently lacking. The dietary 
      biomolecules-based intervention, among other ways, is appealing, safe, and 
      effective. Upregulation of transcription factors, neurotrophic factors, and growth 
      factors such as NGF, GDNF, BDNF, and CTNF may occur as a result of these substances' 
      dietary intake. Upregulation of the signaling pathways ERK, JNK, p38, and PKA has 
      also been seen, which aids in axonal regeneration. Although several mechanistic 
      approaches to understanding their involvement have been suggested, more work is 
      needed to reveal the amazing properties of these biomolecules. We have discussed in 
      this article that how different dietary biomolecules can help with functional 
      recovery and regeneration after an injury. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Based on the 
      information known to date, we may conclude that treatment techniques for peripheral 
      nerve injury have downsides, such as complications, donor shortages, adverse 
      effects, unaffordability, and a lack of precision in efficacy. These difficulties 
      cast doubt on their efficacy and raise severe concerns about the prescription. In 
      this situation, the need for safe and effective therapeutic techniques is 
      unavoidable, and dietary biomolecules appear to be a safe, cost-efficient, and 
      effective way to promote nerve regeneration following an injury. The information on 
      these biomolecules has been summarized here. Upregulation of transcription factors, 
      neurotrophic factors, and growth factors, such as NGF, GDNF, BDNF, and CTNF, as well 
      as the ERK, JNK, p38, and PKA, signaling pathways, may stimulate axonal 
      regeneration.

TI  - An overview of chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) bioactive peptides' derivation and 
      utilization as an emerging nutraceutical food.
PG  - 643-654
LID - 10.52586/4973 [doi]
AB  - Chia (S. hispanica L.) is an annual herbaceous plant that has gained popularity for 
      its seeds of high-quality vegetative proteins, richest contents of omega-3 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (Î©-3 PUFA), soluble dietary fiber, and great gelling 
      ability, as well as its high contents of bioactive peptides of antioxidative and 
      nutraceutical potential for many other clinical biomarkers. Such health protective 
      bioactive peptides should be utilized for supplementation in the food and nutrition 
      industries. This review was therefore designed to align the researches done on chia 
      bioactive peptide's derivation, processing, consumption and to identify their 
      antioxidative and nutraceutical potential for various disease biomarkers. The 
      evidence gathered is fairly compelling for the health-promising nutraceutical and 
      clinical potential of chia seed bioactive peptides as antioxidants, dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-IV inhibitors (DPP4), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and 
      anti-inflammatory drugs. Their assimilation into everyday diets has the potential to 
      open new doors in health departments and food sectors.

TI  - Vitamin D - pivotal nutraceutical in the regulation of cancer metastasis and 
      angiogenesis.
PG  - 4109-20
AB  - Various epidemiological studies have demonstrated that vitamin D may play important 
      roles in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer. Vitamin D is one of the most 
      pivotal nutraceuticals whose active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
      D3), possesses anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and pro-differentiating 
      capabilities. Accumulating evidence indicates that the potential benefits of using 
      vitamin D in cancer are not only anti-cancer cell proliferation which is linked with 
      its anti-inflammatory effects, including the suppression of prostaglandin metabolism 
      and inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling, but also suppressing tumor metastasis and 
      angiogenesis. Here, we present a systematic summary of the effects of vitamin D in 
      the chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer, especially anti-metastatic and 
      anti-angiogenic actions.

TI  - The nutraceutical role of the Phaseolus vulgaris alpha-amylase inhibitor.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1017/S0007114508879135 [doi]
AB  - The present review assesses the potential of the Phaseolus vulgaris alpha-amylase 
      inhibitor isoform 1 (alpha-AI1) starch blockers as a widely used remedy against 
      obesity and diabetes. Consumption of the alpha-amylase inhibitor causes marginal 
      intraluminal alpha-amylase activity facilitated by the inhibitor's appropriate 
      structural, physico-chemical and functional properties. As a result there is 
      decreased postprandial plasma hyperglycaemia and insulin levels, increased 
      resistance of starch to digestion and increased activity of colorectal bacteria. The 
      efficacy and safety of the amylase inhibitor extracts, however, depend on the 
      processing and extraction techniques used. The extracts are potential ingredients in 
      foods for increased carbohydrate tolerance in diabetics, decreased energy intake for 
      reducing obesity and for increased resistant starch. Research developments in the 
      distribution and biosynthesis of the alpha-amylase inhibitor, relevant 
      physico-chemical properties, the molecular starch-blocking mechanism, anti-obesity 
      and anti-diabetes effects, safety of extracts and the need for research into their 
      potential anti-colorectal cancer effect are discussed.

AB  - Conventional and organic cinnamon and peppermint were investigated for their 
      phenolic profile, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. 
      Accelerated solvent extraction with 75% acetone was used to extract samples. Caffeic 
      acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in peppermint. Catechin, 
      (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, syringic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, and 
      p-coumaric acid were also detected in both spices. There was no significant 
      difference between conventional and organic spices in the composition of most 
      individual phenolics. All conventional and organic peppermint and cinnamon extracts 
      exhibited strong anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Cinnamon was 
      more efficient in inhibiting IL-1Î² and COX-2 expression, while peppermint showed 
      better inhibitory effect on IL-6 and MCP-1. This study indicates that cinnamon and 
      peppermint may potentially be used as dietary sources of bioactive phytochemicals 
      for improving health.

AB  - The demand from consumer for safe and nutritious berry and berry products has 
      promoted the rapid development of non-conventional processing technologies. This 
      review summarizes the recent advances of thermal and non-thermal processing 
      technologies in berry and berry products, including microwave, ohmic heating, high 
      pressure processing, irradiation, dense phase carbon dioxide, ultrasonic processing, 
      pulsed electric field, ozone, membrane processing technologies, cold plasma, and 
      hydrothermodynamic cavitation. These technologies individually or in combination 
      have shown great potential for extraction, sterilization, drying, concentration and 
      deacidfication. They could decrease processing time and temperature, improve 
      processing efficiency and minimize nutritional losses, as well as reduce energy 
      consumption. Given the nutritional benefits of anthocyanins and other polyphenols in 
      berry, their content and compositional change during processing were highlighted, as 
      well as the primarily studies of the underlying mechanisms. The advantage and 
      limitation of these technologies are also discussed along with the perspective 
      insight of their future development.

AB  - Sarcopenia is a commonly prevalent geriatric condition mainly characterized by 
      progressive loss of the skeletal muscle mass that results in noticeably reduced 
      muscle strength and quality. Most of the geriatric population above 60 years of age 
      are overweight, leading to the accumulation of fat in the muscles resulting in 
      abated muscle function. The increased loss of muscle mass is associated with high 
      rates of disability, poor motility, frailty and mortality. The excessive 
      degeneration of muscles is now also being observed in middle-aged people. Therefore, 
      geriatrics has recently started shifting towards the identification of early stages 
      of the disability in order to expand the life span of the patient and reduce 
      physical dependence. Recent findings have indicated that patients with increased 
      physical activity are also affected by sarcopenia, therefore indicating the role of 
      nutritional supplements to enhance muscle health which in turn helps to counteract 
      sarcopenia. Various interventions with physical training have not provided 
      substantial improvements to this disorder, thereby highlighting the crucial role of 
      nutritional supplementation in enhancing muscle mass and strength. Nutritional 
      supplementation has not only been shown to enhance the positive effects of physical 
      interventions but also have a profound impact on the gut microbiome that has come 
      forward as a key regulator of muscle mass and function. This brief review throws 
      light upon the efficiency of nutrients and nutraceutical supplementation by 
      highlighting their ancillary effects in physical interventions as well as improving 
      the gut microbiome status in sarcopenic adults, thereby giving rise to a multimodal 
      intervention for the treatment of sarcopenia.

TI  - A nutraceutical combination of cinnamon, purple onion, and tea linked with key 
      enzymes on treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - e13971

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is concomitant with significant morbidity and mortality and 
      its prevalence is accumulative worldwide. The conventional antidiabetic agents are 
      known to mitigate the symptoms of diabetes; however, they may also cause adverse 
      effects. This study was to explore the efficacy of polyherbal dietary supplement 
      cinnamon, purple onion, and tea on the mediation of postprandial hyperglycemia in 
      the search of combinations with a maximal response. A starch solution (3Â g/kg Bwt) 
      of oral starch tolerance test (OSTT) and glucose solution (4Â g/kg Bwt) of oral 
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with and without cinnamon, purple onion, tea extract 
      (15Â mg/kg Bwt), and mixture (each 5Â mg/kg Bwt, 1:1:1), metformin (14Â mg/kg Bwt), or 
      acarbose (50Â mg/kg Bwt) was administered to high fat plus high fructose-induced 
      diabetic mice after an overnight fast. Postprandial plasma glucose levels were 
      measured and changed areas under the response curve were calculated to find out the 
      maximal efficacy of optimal polyherbal combinations. Compared with acarbose, the 
      mixture of extracts (purple onion, cinnamon, and tea) indicated the decreasing blood 
      glucose in OSTT. In OGTT, the mixture of extracts showed greater efficacy for 
      hypoglycemia when compared with metformin. The molecular docking of Î±-amylase, 
      Î±-glucosidase, and AMPK was further confirmed the putatively acting molecules from 
      the extracts of purple onion, cinnamon, and tea. Overall, this investigation 
      evidenced a beneficial mediation for the progression of lowering blood glucose with 
      a combinatory extract of cinnamon, dietary onion, and tea, implicating their 
      prospective as nutraceuticals that might ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetes. 
      PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of metabolic syndrome, 
      attributes to risk factors like obesity, physical inactivity, ageing, life style, 
      and genetic predisposition even with significant morbidity and mortality. DM is 
      increasing and accounts for an estimated annual medical expenditure of US$ 827 
      billion worldwide. Therefore, maintaining blood glucose levels within the normal 
      range is critical for preventing diabetes and its co-morbidities. The conventional 
      antidiabetic agents are known to mitigate the symptoms of diabetes; nevertheless, 
      they may also cause adverse or side effects. In an effort to design novel and 
      well-tolerated solutions to halt the progression of DM, however evidence-base is 
      extremely limited regarding the efficacy of polyherbal dietary supplement individual 
      herbs for the management of glycemia. In this investigation evidenced a beneficial 
      mediation for the progression of lowering blood glucose with a combinatory extract 
      of cinnamon, dietary onion, and tea, implicating their prospective as nutraceuticals 
      that might ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetes.

TI  - Physicochemical properties of fucoidan and its applications as building blocks of 
      nutraceutical delivery systems.

LID - 10.1080/10408398.2021.1937042 [doi]
AB  - Many bioactive ingredients with health effects such as antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective possess low bioavailability due to poor 
      solubility and sensitivity. Fucoidan is an ideal material for encapsulating 
      bioactive ingredients because of its unique physicochemical and biological 
      properties, which can improve the function and application of bioactive ingredients. 
      Nevertheless, there is still a lack of review about the physicochemical properties 
      as well as functionalities of fucoidan and the application of fucoidan-based 
      delivery systems in functional food. Hence, in this review, recent advances on the 
      structure, chemical modification, physicochemical properties and biological activity 
      of fucoidan are summarized. This review systematacially describes the recent update 
      on the fucoidan as a wall material for delivering nutraceuticals with a broad 
      discussion on various types of delivery systems ranging from nanoparticles, 
      nanoparticle/bead complexes, emulsions, edible films, nanocapsules and hydrogels. 
      Futhermore, the technical scientific issues of the application of fucoidan in the 
      field of food are emphasized. On the basis of more comprehensive and deeper 
      understandings, the review ends with a concluding remark on future directions of 
      fucoidan-based delivery systems for purposes. Novel fucoidan-based delivery systems 
      such as aerogels, Pickering emulsions, emulsion-filled-hydrogels, 
      liposomes-in-fucoidan, co-delivery systems of bioactive igredients can be designed.

TI  - Factors impacting lipid digestion and nutraceutical bioaccessibility assessed by

AB  - This paper is part of a series examining the impact of the main factors influencing 
      lipid digestion and nutraceutical bioaccessibility in Î²-carotene-loaded oil-in-water 
      emulsions using the harmonized INFOGEST simulated gastrointestinal model. Here, the 
      impact of emulsifier type was examined since food emulsions and nutraceutical 
      delivery systems are often stabilized by various types of emulsifier. The INFOGEST 
      method was adopted to investigate the in vitro gastrointestinal fate of emulsions 
      stabilized by five kinds of food-grade emulsifier representing different classes: 
      synthetic surfactants (Tween 20); natural surfactants (quillaja saponin); proteins 
      (caseinate); polysaccharides (gum arabic); and phospholipids (soy lysolecithin). 
      Microfluidization produced emulsions with small droplet sizes for all emulsifiers, 
      except soy lysolecithin. Within the gastrointestinal model, the caseinate-coated oil 
      droplets had the worst gastric stability, with severe droplet flocculation and 
      coalescence occurring in the stomach. The fraction of the lipid phase that had been 
      digested by the end of the gastrointestinal model was considerably lower for the 
      emulsions stabilized by soy lysolecithin (93%) or caseinate (93%), than those 
      stabilized by gum arabic (99%), quillaja saponin (111%) or Tween 20 (117%). This 
      effect was attributed to lower surface area of lipids available for lipase to attach 
      to for the lysolecithin and caseinate emulsions. The overall bioaccessibility of the 
      Î²-carotene increased in this order: lysolecithin (25%)Â <Â gum arabic 
      (51%)Â <Â caseinate (55%)Â <Â quillaja saponin (56%)Â <Â Tween 20 (62%). The impact of 
      emulsifier type on carotenoid bioaccessibility was ascribed to various factors: (i) 
      some emulsifiers inhibited lipid digestion and so a fraction of the Î²-carotene 
      remained inside the undigested droplets and the mixed micelle phase had less 
      solubilization capacity, i.e., lysolecithin, and caseinate; (ii) some emulsifiers 
      protected Î²-carotene from chemical degradation, i.e., lysolecithin and caseinate; 
      and (iii) some emulsifiers promoted sedimentation of the Î²-carotene-loaded micelles, 
      i.e., lysolecithin. These results suggest that food emulsion behavior in the human 
      gut may be influenced by the nature of the emulsifier employed, which is important 
      knowledge when creating functional food and beverage products.

AB  - Food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are 3 major food constituents with 
      distinctly different functional attributes. Many proteins and polysaccharides are 
      capable of stabilizing emulsions and foams, thickening solutions, and forming gels, 
      although they differ considerably in their abilities to provide these functional 
      attributes. Many plant polyphenols exhibit beneficial physiological functions, such 
      as antitumor, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Proteins, 
      polysaccharides, and polyphenols can form complexes with each other, which leads to 
      changes in the functional and nutritional properties of the combined systems. 
      Recently, there has been considerable interest in understanding and utilizing 
      covalent interactions between polyphenols and biopolymers (proteins and 
      polysaccharides). The binary or tertiary conjugates formed may be designed to have 
      physicochemical properties and functional attributes that cannot be achieved using 
      the individual components. This article provides a review of the formation, 
      characterization, and utilization of conjugates prepared using proteins, 
      polysaccharides, and polyphenols. It also discusses the relationship between the 
      structural properties and functionality of the conjugates, and it highlights the 
      bioavailability of bioactive compounds loaded in conjugate-based delivery systems. 
      In addition, it highlights the main challenges to be considered when preparing and 
      analyzing conjugates. This article provides an improved understanding of the 
      chemical reactions that occur between major food ingredients and how they can be 
      utilized to develop biopolymer-based delivery systems with enhanced functional 
      attributes.

TI  - Supramolecular self-assembly and perfected in vitro/vivo property of 5-fluorouracil 
      and ferulic acid on the strength of double optimized strategy: the first 
      5-fluorouracial-phenolic acid nutraceutical cocrystal with synergistic antitumor 
      efficacy.
PG  - 2506-2519
LID - 10.1039/d1an00171j [doi]
AB  - For highlighting the predominance of phenolic acid nutraceutical ferulic acid (FR) 
      in regulating the in vivo/vitro performances of anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (Flu) 
      and strengthening their cooperativity in antitumor effect, thus achieving a major 
      breakthrough in the development of drug-nutraceutical cocrystal with synergistic 
      antitumor action, a cocrystallization strategy of dual optimization is created, in 
      which both the in vivo and vitro natures of Flu are improved by exploiting the FR's 
      excellent physicochemical property. Moreover, Flu's anticancer effects were promoted 
      by exerting the assistant antitumor peculiarity of FR. Such dual optimization of FR 
      for Flu in physicochemical properties and anticancer activities is beneficial for 
      realizing synergistic augmentation effect by taking the benefit of the 
      cooperativeness of Flu and FR in the anticancer ability. Based on this idea, a novel 
      cocrystal of Flu and FR, namely, Flu-FR-H2O, is successfully assembled as the first 
      5-fluorouracil-nutraceutical cocrystal with synergistic antitumor effect and its 
      explicit structure is resolved. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction demonstrates 
      that Flu and FR have a ratio of 1â:â1 with one equivalent of solvent water in the 
      cocrystal, where one-dimensional hydrogen-bonding helices and FR-Flu 
      hydrogen-bonding pairs, together construct a three-dimensional supramolecular 
      network. By combining experimental evaluation with theoretical analysis, in 
      vitro/vivo pharmaceutical properties are scientifically investigated. Results show 
      that the permeability and aqueous solubility of Flu are respectively elevated by 
      5.08 and 1.64 folds, which has brought about ameliorated pharmacokinetics, thus 
      providing prolonged retention time and increased oral bioavailability. More 
      interestingly, the cocrystal shows synergistic inhibition ability of Flu and FR 
      against tested tumor cell strains, hence laying the groundwork for reducing the 
      dosage and even the toxic side effects of Flu. As a result of this, the present 
      research not only provides a new strategy for Flu to optimize its physicochemical 
      properties and antitumor activities simultaneously but also offers some opinions for 
      the development of synergistic antitumor pharmaceutical cocrystals.

TI  - Insulin-resistance and depression cohort data mining to identify nutraceutical 
      related DNA methylation biomarker for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 669-676

AB  - Insulin-resistance (IR) is one of the most important precursors of type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D). Recent evidence suggests an association of depression with the onset of T2D. 
      Accumulating evidence shows that depression and T2D share common biological origins, 
      and DNA methylation examination might reveal the link between lifestyle, disease 
      risk, and potential therapeutic targets for T2D. Here we hypothesize that 
      integrative mining of IR and depression cohort data will facilitate predictive 
      biomarkers identification for T2D. We utilized a newly proposed method to extract 
      gene-level information from probe level data on genome-wide DNA methylation array. 
      We identified a set of genes associated with IR and depression in clinical cohorts. 
      By overlapping the IR-related nutraceutical-gene network with depression networks, 
      we identified a common subnetwork centered with Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene. 
      Preliminary clinical validation of gene methylation set in a small cohort of T2D 
      patients and controls was established using the Sequenome matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption ionization-time flight mass spectrometry. A set of sites in the promoter 
      regions of VDR showed a significant difference between T2D patients and controls. 
      Using a logistic regression model, the optimal prediction performance of these sites 
      was AUCÂ =Â 0.902ï¼and an odds ratioÂ =Â 19.76. Thus, monitoring the methylation status 
      of specific VDR promoter region might help stratify the high-risk individuals who 
      could potentially benefit from vitamin D dietary supplementation. Our results 
      highlight the link between IR and depression, and the DNA methylation analysis might 
      facilitate the search for their shared mechanisms in the etiology of T2D.

AB  - In this study, the mechanism activated by melatonin treatment at 100â¯ÂµM for 
      maintaining nutraceutical properties in pomegranate fruits during storage at 4â¯Â°C 
      for 120â¯days was investigated. Our results showed that the higher G6PDH and 6PGDH 
      activities in pomegranate fruits treated with melatonin may be responsible for 
      sufficient supply of intracellular NADPH. Also, higher AA and GSH accumulation in 
      pomegranate fruits treated with melatonin may ascribe to higher APX and GR 
      activities coincided with lower AAO activity. In addition, pomegranate fruits 
      treated with melatonin exhibited significantly higher PAL activity resulting in 
      higher phenols and anthocyanins accumulation as well as higher DPPH scavenging 
      capacity. Additionally, higher AOX gene expression in pomegranate fruits treated 
      with melatonin may be beneficial for ROS scavenging molecules accumulation. 
      Therefore, maintaining nutraceutical properties of pomegranate fruits treated with 
      melatonin may ascribe to sufficient intracellular NADPH supply by promoting G6PDH 
      and 6PGDH activities during cold storage.

      root as potential hepatoprotective nutraceutical.
PG  - e13259
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.13259 [doi]
AB  - Morus australis distributed widely in China has high value in food and agriculture. 
      Twelve phenolic compounds were isolated and identified as major constituents of M. 
      australis root from Shaanxi province, China, while the protective effect of M. 
      australis root on liver injury has never been determined in detail. In this study, 
      the hepatoprotective ability of M. australis root was investigated in vivo and in 
      vitro. The ethanol-water extract prepared from M. australis root showed protection 
      on alcohol-induced liver damage in mice by decreasing the levels of serum alanine 
      aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, triacylglycerol and malondialdehyde, and 
      by increasing glutathione contents. Furthermore, among 12 major constituents of M. 
      australis root, 10 flavonoids (especially 1) showed protection against carbon 
      tetrachloride (CCl(4) )-intoxicated HepG2 cell lines by decreased lactic 
      dehydrogenase levels. In addition a validated HPLC-DAD method was established for 
      the quantitative analysis of 10 flavonoids in the bioactive extract. PRACTICAL 
      APPLICATIONS: Our results showed that M. australis root extract significantly 
      alleviated the liver damage in mice. Ten flavonoids from the root of this plant 
      exhibited protection on CCl(4) -intoxicated HepG2 cell lines. This study suggests 
      that Morus australis root has hepatoprotective potential as a promising supplement 
      for the prevention and treatment of liver diseases.

TI  - Influence of Rhizoglomus irregulare on nutraceutical quality and regeneration of 
      Lycium barbarum leaves under salt stress.
PG  - 365-374
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2016-0597 [doi]
AB  - Whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi augment the nutraceutical quality of crops 
      under salt stress is critical as a potential agronomic practice in salinized 
      farmland. To evaluate the effect of Rhizoglomus irregulare on the nutraceutical 
      quality of Lycium barbarum leaves under salt stress, we analyzed growth parameters 
      and the rutin, polysaccharide, acidic polysaccharide, and amino acids contents of 2 
      harvests. Inoculation of R. irregulare significantly increased the regenerated bud 
      number (partial eta squared (PES) = 0.577, P < 0.0001) and rutin concentration (PES 
      = 0.544, P < 0.001) of L. barbarum leaves, with and without salt stress. The biomass 
      of the 2nd harvest (PES = 0.355, P = 0.0091) and acidic polysaccharide (PES = 0.518, 
      P = 0.001) of L. barbarum leaves were notably enhanced by R. irregulare under 200 
      mmol/L salt level. Rhizoglomus irregulare had insignificant effect on polysaccharide 
      (PES = 0.092, P = 0.221) and amino acids levels (PES = 0.263, P = 0.130) in the 
      leaves of L. barbarum. However, inoculation by R. irregulare decreased proline level 
      (PES = 0.761, P = 0.001) in the leaves of L. barbarum when subjected to salt stress. 
      Taken together, these results indicate that R. irregulare significantly improved the 
      nutraceutical quality and facilitated the sustainable production of L. barbarum 
      leaves exposed to salt stress.

TI  - Direct enzymatic ethanolysis of potential Nannochloropsis biomass for co-production 
      of sustainable biodiesel and nutraceutical eicosapentaenoic acid.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Marine microalga Nannochloropsis is a promising source for the 
      production of renewable and sustainable biodiesel in replacement of depleting 
      petroleum. Other than biodiesel, Nannochloropsis is a green and potential resource 
      for the commercial production of nutraceutical eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C(20:5)). 
      In recent studies, low-value biodiesel can be achieved by transesterification of 
      Nannochloropsis biomass. However, it is undoubtedly wasteful to produce microalgal 
      biodiesel containing EPA from nutritional and economical aspects. A new strategy was 
      addressed and exploited to produce low-value bulky biodiesel along with EPA 
      enrichment via enzymatic ethanolysis of Nannochloropsis biomass with a specific 
      lipase. RESULTS: Cellulase pretreatment on Nannochloropsis sp. biomass significantly 
      improved the biodiesel conversion by direct ethanolysis with five enzymes from 
      Candida antarctica (CALA and CALB), Thermomyces lanuginosus (TL), Rhizomucor miehei 
      (RM), and Aspergillus oryzae (PLA). Among these five biocatalysts, CALA was the best 
      suitable enzyme to yield high biodiesel conversion and effectively enrich EPA. After 
      optimization, the maximum biodiesel conversion (46.53-48.57%) was attained by CALA 
      at 8:1 ethanol/biomass ratio (v/w) in 10-15% water content with 10% lipase weight at 
      35Â Â°C for 72Â h. Meanwhile, EPA (60.81%) was highly enriched in microalgae NPLs 
      (neutral lipids and polar lipids), increasing original EPA levels by 1.51-fold. 
      Moreover, this process was re-evaluated with two Nannochloropsis species (IMET1 and 
      Salina 537). Under the optimized conditions, the biodiesel conversions of IMET1 and 
      Salina 537 by CALA were 63.41% and 54.33%, respectively. EPA contents of microalgal 
      NPLs were 50.06% for IMET1 and 53.73% for Salina 537. CONCLUSION: CALA was the 
      potential biocatalyst to discriminate against EPA in the ethanolysis of 
      Nannochloropsis biomass. The biodiesel conversion and EPA enrich efficiency of CALA 
      were greatly dependent on lipidic class and fatty acid compositions of 
      Nannochloropsis biomass. CALA-catalyzed ethanolysis with Nannochloropsis biomass was 
      a promising approach for co-production of low-value biodiesel and high-value 
      microalgae products rich in EPA.

AB  - The genomes of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare and 93-11, have been well studied. 
      However, there is little available genetic information about nutraceutical rice 
      cultivars. To remedy this situation, the present study aimed to provide a basic 
      genetic landscape of nutraceutical rice. The genome of Black-1, a black pericarp 
      rice containing higher levels of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and a more potent 
      antioxidant capacity, was sequenced at â¥30Â ÃÂ coverage using Solexa sequencing 
      technology. The complete sequences of Black-1 genome shared more consensus sequences 
      with indica cultivar 93-11 than with Nipponbare. With reference to the 93-11 genome, 
      Black-1 contained 675,207 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 43,130 insertions and 
      deletions (1-5Â bp), 1,770 copy number variations, and 10,911 presence/absence 
      variations. These variations were observed to reside preferentially in Myb domains, 
      NB-ARC domains and kinase domains, providing clues to the diversity of biological 
      functions or secondary metabolisms in this cultivar. Intriguingly, 496 unique genes 
      were identified by comparing it with the genomes of these two rice varieties; among 
      the genes, 119 genes participate in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. 
      Furthermore, several unique genes were predicted to be involved in the anthocyanins 
      synthesis pathway. The genome-wide landscape of Black-1 uncovered by this study 
      represents a valuable resource for further studies and for breeding nutraceutical 
      rice varieties.

AB  - Blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) have great beneficial effects, and their leaves are 
      rich in phenolics. In the present study, the total phenolic, total flavonoid, and 
      proanthocyanidin contents in the leaf extracts from 73 different blueberry cultivars 
      among five categories were investigated. The phenolic composition was analyzed, and 
      the antioxidants were also evaluated. Here, a total of 23 individual phenolic 
      constituents were identified, among which eight predominant phenolics were 
      quantified, including five caffeoylquinic acids, two quercetin glycosides, and one 
      kaempferol glycoside. The different cultivars could be well clustered according to 
      their phenolic compositions and antioxidant capacities. The correlations among the 
      quantified phenolic constituents and the antioxidant capacities were determined 
      using principal component analysis. The results indicated that blueberry leaves may 
      be a potential resource of antioxidant phenolics, and the differences among the 
      cultivars should be considered when blueberry leaves are further developed.

TI  - Production of tocotrienols in seeds of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) enhances 
      oxidative stability and offers nutraceutical potential.
PG  - 1268-1282
LID - 10.1111/pbi.13557 [doi]
AB  - Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an economically important multi-purpose 
      crop cultivated globally for fibre, seed oil and protein. Cottonseed oil also is 
      naturally rich in vitamin E components (collectively known as tocochromanols), with 
      Î±- and Î³-tocopherols comprising nearly all of the vitamin E components. By contrast, 
      cottonseeds have little or no tocotrienols, tocochromanols with a wide range of 
      health benefits. Here, we generated transgenic cotton lines expressing the barley 
      (Hordeum vulgare) homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase coding sequence under the 
      control of the Brassica napus seed-specific promoter, napin. Transgenic cottonseeds 
      had ~twofold to threefold increases in the accumulation of total vitamin E 
      (tocopherolsÂ +Â tocotrienols), with more than 60% Î³-tocotrienol. Matrix assisted 
      laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging showed that Î³-tocotrienol was 
      localized throughout the transgenic embryos. In contrast, the native tocopherols 
      were distributed unequally in both transgenic and non-transgenic embryos. Î±- 
      Tocopherol was restricted mostly to cotyledon tissues and Î³-tocopherol was more 
      enriched in the embryonic axis tissues. Production of tocotrienols in cotton embryos 
      had no negative impact on plant performance or yield of other important seed 
      constituents including fibre, oil and protein. Advanced generations of two 
      transgenic events were field grown, and extracts of transgenic seeds showed 
      increased antioxidant activity relative to extracts from non-transgenic seeds. 
      Furthermore, refined cottonseed oil from the two transgenic events showed 30% 
      improvement in oxidative stability relative to the non-transgenic cottonseed oil. 
      Taken together, these materials may provide new opportunities for cottonseed 
      co-products with enhanced vitamin E profile for improved shelf life and nutrition.

TI  - Leveraging plant exine capsules as pH-responsive delivery vehicles for hydrophobic 
      nutraceutical encapsulation.
PG  - 5436-5442
LID - 10.1039/c8fo01665h [doi]
AB  - Plant exine capsules are natural microscale capsules that are highly physically 
      robust and chemically resilient. They are extracted from pollen grains and plant 
      spores, and can be used as renewable and safe microcapsules for encapsulation 
      applications. Herein, we report the successful evacuation of natural sunflower 
      pollen grains (SPGs) and Lycopodiastrum casuarinoides spore exine capsules (SECs) 
      and investigated the effects of different loading methods on the encapsulation and 
      release of nobiletin, a model hydrophobic nutraceutical. The compositional and 
      morphological characterizations of SPGs and SECs obtained by the developed 
      extraction protocol confirmed that the inside contents had been removed and hollow 
      pollen cavities were obtained successfully. In addition, coumarin-6, a hydrophobic 
      fluorescent probe, was encapsulated into SPGs and SECs, which proved the possibility 
      of using them to encapsulate hydrophobic nutraceuticals. Furthermore, controlled 
      release in simulated digestive fluids (SDF) was achieved by coating calcium alginate 
      onto the outside of the SPGs and SECs. Looking forward, this may provide an 
      effective and potential delivery model to protect loads from degradation in the 
      stomach and achieve pH-responsive delivery of hydrophobic nutraceuticals after oral 
      administration.

TI  - An antidiabetic nutraceutical combination of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus), 
      bitter gourd (Momordica charantia), and chromium alleviates dedifferentiation of 
      pancreatic Î² cells in db/db mice.
PG  - 6718-6726

AB  - Antidiabetic properties of red yeast rice, bitter gourd, and chromium have gained 
      scientific support. This study aimed to test whether a nutraceutical combination of 
      these 3 materials prevented dedifferentiation of pancreatic Î² cells. Male db/db mice 
      (8Â weeks of age) were allocated into four groups (DB, DB/L, DB/M, and DB/H; 
      nÂ =Â 8-10) and fed a high-fat diet containing 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 1% nutraceutical, 
      respectively, whereas wild-type mice receiving a standard diet served as a healthy 
      control (C; nÂ =Â 10). The nutraceutical contained 10Â mg/g monacolin K, 165Â Âµg/g 
      chromium, and 300Â mg/g bitter gourd. After 8-weeks dietary treatment, diabetic 
      syndromes (including hyperglycemia, hyperphagia, excessive drinking, polyuria, 
      glucosuria, albuminuria, and glucose intolerance), were improved by the 
      nutraceutical in a dose-dependent fashion. Decreased insulin and increased glucagon 
      in serum and pancreatic islets in db/db mice were abolished in the DB/H group. 
      Furthermore, supplementation curtailed dedifferentiation of Î² cells, as evidenced by 
      decreasing the dedifferentiation marker (Aldh1a3) and increasing Î²-cell-enriched 
      genes and transcription factors (Ins1, Ins2, FOXO1, and NKX6.1), as well as nuclear 
      localization of NKX6.1 in pancreatic islets when compared to the DB group. We 
      concluded that this nutraceutical, a combination of Monascus purpureus, Momordica 
      charantia, and chromium, could be used as an adjunct for type 2 diabetes treatment 
      and delay disease progression by sustaining Î²-cell function.

AB  - In this work, in order to enhance the stability, bioavailability and antioxidant 
      activity of insoluble antioxidants used into juice, yoghourt and nutritional 
      supplements, the oligo-hyalurosomes nano-delivery system (CRHs) based on 
      oligo-hyaluronic acid -curcumin (oHC) polymer loaded curcumin(Cur) and resveratrol 
      (Res) was fabricated with new nanotechnolgy. The rosy biodegradable amphiphilic oHC 
      polymer was successfully synthesized and used to fabricate the hyalurosomes 
      containing both Cur and Res, called CRHs. The CRHs can spontaneously self-assemble 
      into nano-sized spherical shape of average particle size 134.5Â±5.1nm and Zeta 
      potential -29.4Â±1.2 at pH 7.4 PBS conditions. In vitro gastrointestinal release test 
      showed a perfect stability and outstanding sustained release character. Moreover, 
      compared to the single formulations and liposomes, CRHs showed a dose-dependent 
      manner with a higher radical scavenging activity. Therefore, the novel CRHs 
      nano-food manifested the hopeful properties for the new effective gastrointestinal 
      formulation and promising new nano-food delivery system in the use of juice, 
      yoghourt and nutritional supplements.

TI  - Ursolic Acid, a Natural Nutraceutical Agent, Targets Caspase3 and Alleviates 
      Inflammation-Associated Downstream Signal Transduction.
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201700332 [doi]
LID - 1700332
AB  - SCOPE: Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclicterpenoid carboxylic acid that is present 
      in a wide variety of plant foods. There are many beneficial health effects that are 
      attributed to the properties of UA. However, the specific cellular targets of UA and 
      the mechanism underlying downstream signal transduction processes linked to the 
      anti-inflammation pathway have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Chemical biology strategies such as target fishing, click reaction 
      synthesis of a UA probe and molecular imaging were used to identify potential target 
      proteins of UA. Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (CASP3) and its downstream 
      signaling pathway were verified as potential targets by molecular docking, 
      intracellular enzyme activity evaluation and accurate pathway analysis. The results 
      indicated that UA acted on CASP3, ERK1 and JNK2 targets, alleviated 
      inflammation-associated downstream multiple signal transduction factors, including 
      ERK1, NF-ÎºB and STAT3, and exhibited anti-inflammation activities. CONCLUSION: As a 
      natural dietary supplement, UA demonstrated anti-inflammation activity via 
      inhibition of CASP3 and shows the potential to improve the therapy effect of several 
      inflammation-associated diseases.

TI  - Cholesterol-Lowering Action of a Novel Nutraceutical Combination in Uremic Rats: 
      Insights into the Molecular Mechanism in a Hepatoma Cell Line.
LID - 10.3390/nu12020436 [doi]
LID - 436
AB  - Appropriate nutraceutical combinations may represent a valid approach to prevent 
      vascular calcification associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present 
      study, we tested the effect of a new nutraceutical combination named RenaTris(Â®), 
      containing MK-7, magnesium carbonate, and Sucrosomial(Â®) Iron, on vascular 
      calcification in uremic rats. Rats were randomly divided into three groups, i.e. 
      control (high-phosphate diet), uremic (high-phosphate diet containing 0.5% adenine), 
      and supplemented uremic diet (0.5% adenine, MK-7, magnesium carbonate, and 
      Sucrosomial(Â®) Iron). After six weeks, sera and vascular calcification were 
      examined. The uremic diet increased creatinine and phosphate levels and induced 
      extensive vascular calcification. The uremic condition also induced a mild 
      hypercholesterolemic condition (+52% of total cholesterol; p < 0.05). The 
      supplemented uremic diet did not reduce creatinine, phosphate levels, or vascular 
      calcification, however, we observed a significant hypocholesterolemic effect (-18.9% 
      in supplemental uremic vs. uremic diet; p < 0.05). Similar to simvastatin, 
      incubation of cultured human hepatoma cells (Huh7) with MK-7 significantly reduced 
      cholesterol biosynthesis (-38%) and induced 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA 
      (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) at both mRNA and 
      protein levels. The effect of MK-7 on LDLR was counteracted by the co-incubation 
      with squalene. Unlike simvastatin, MK-7 reduced PCSK9 in Huh7. These results 
      indicated that the new nutraceutical combination significantly impacts cholesterol 
      metabolism and its supplementation may help to control mild hypercholesterolemic 
      conditions in CKD patients.

TI  - A Potential Nutraceutical Candidate Lactucin Inhibits Adipogenesis through 
      Downregulation of JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway-Mediated Mitotic Clonal Expansion.
LID - 10.3390/cells9020331 [doi]
LID - 331
AB  - The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically worldwide in the past ~50 
      years. Searching for safe and effective anti-obesity strategies are urgently needed. 
      Lactucin, a plant-derived natural small molecule, is known for anti-malaria and 
      anti-hyperalgesia. The study is to investigate whether lactucin plays a key role in 
      adipogenesis. To this end, in vivo male C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were 
      treated with 20 mg/kg/day of lactucin or vehicle by gavage for seven weeks. Compared 
      with vehicle-treated controls, Lactucin-treated mice showed lower body mass and mass 
      of adipose tissue. Consistently, in vitro 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 20 Î¼M of 
      lactucin. Compared to controls, lactucin-treated cells showed significantly less 
      lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation and lower levels of lipid 
      synthesis markers. Mechanistically, we showed the anti-adipogenic property of 
      lactucin was largely limited to the early stage of adipogenesis. Lactucin-treated 
      cells fail to undergo mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). Further studies demonstrate 
      that lactucin-induced MCE arrests might result from reduced phosphorylation of JAK2 
      and STAT3. We then asked whether activation of JAK2/STAT3 would restore the 
      inhibitory effect of lactucin on adipogenesis with pharmacological STAT3 activator 
      colivelin. Our results revealed similar levels of lipid accumulation between 
      lactucin-treated cells and controls in the presence of colivelin, indicating that 
      inactivation of STAT3 is the limiting factor for the anti-adipogenesis of lactucin 
      in these cells. Together, our results provide the indication that lactucin exerts an 
      anti-adipogenesis effect, which may open new therapeutic options for obesity.

TI  - Supramolecular self-assembly of amantadine hydrochloride with ferulic acid via dual 
      optimization strategy establishes a precedent of synergistic antiviral drug-phenolic 
      acid nutraceutical cocrystal.
PG  - 3988-3999
LID - 10.1039/d1an00478f [doi]
AB  - To display the capability of the phenolic acid nutraceutical ferulic acid (FLA) in 
      optimizing the in vitro/in vivo properties of the antiviral drug amantadine 
      hydrochloride (AMH) and achieve synergistically enhanced antiviral effects, thereby 
      gaining some new insights into pharmaceutical cocrystals of antiviral drugs with 
      phenolic acid nutraceuticals, a cocrystallization strategy of dual optimization was 
      created. Based on this strategy, the first drug-phenolic acid nutraceutical 
      cocrystal of AMH with FLA, namely AMH-FLA-H2O, was successfully assembled and 
      completely characterized by employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction and other 
      analytical techniques. The cocrystal was revealed to be composed of AMH, FLA, and 
      water molecules in the ratio of 3â:â1â:â1.5, and charge-assisted hydrogen bonds 
      containing chloride ions crucially maintained the crystal lattice together with 
      water molecules. The in vitro/in vivo properties of the cocrystal were 
      systematically evaluated via both theoretical and experimental methods, and the 
      results indicate that the dissolubility of AMH is down-regulated by two-thirds in 
      the cocrystal, resulting in its potential for sustained pharmacokinetic release and 
      the elimination of the adverse effects of AMH. More importantly, the enhanced 
      antiviral effects of the current cocrystal were proven against four viral strains, 
      and the pharmaceutical synergy between AMH and FLA was realized with a combination 
      index (CI) of less than 1. Thus, the present work provides a novel crystalline 
      product with bright commercial prospect for the classical antiviral drug AMH and 
      also establishes an avenue for the synergetic antiviral application of nutraceutical 
      phenolic acids via the cocrystallization strategy of dual optimization.

AB  - Mung bean is a legume crop which has a various health-promoting effects. Although 
      rich flavonoids are reported to be responsible for its biological activities, little 
      is known about other nutrients that may potentiate the activities. To obtain 
      information on mung bean nutritional properties, gel-free/label-free proteomic 
      analysis and metabolomic profiling were combined. Pathway reconstruction detected 
      that amino acid metabolism is more active in flesh. Coat contained wider variety of 
      lipids and phenolic acids/flavonoids than flesh. Among the compounds detected in 
      coat, sphingolipids, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin E2 are compounds which are 
      related to immune response induction. Furthermore, identification of prostaglandin 
      F2Î± added scientific support to empirical validity of mung bean usage. The abundance 
      of bioactive compounds such as naringenin, which can be metabolized into vitexin, 
      varied among cultivars. These results suggest that lipids together with flavonoids 
      might be potential responsible compounds for biological activity of mung bean coat 
      and flesh.

TI  - Protein-Based Pickering High Internal Phase Emulsions as Nutraceutical Vehicles of 
      and the Template for Advanced Materials: A Perspective Paper.
PG  - 9719-9726
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03356 [doi]
AB  - Pickering high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) are normally highly concentrated 
      emulsions stabilized by colloidal particles with a minimum internal phase volume 
      fraction of 0.74. They have received considerable attention in many fields, 
      including pharmaceuticals, tissue engineering, foods, and personal care products. 
      The aim of this perspective is to update the current knowledge on the field of 
      protein-based Pickering HIPEs, emphasizing those aspects that need to be explored 
      and clarified. Research progress in constructing HIPEs by protein-type colloid 
      particles and promising research trends in basic research and potential applications 
      were highlighted. Promising studies in this field include (1) clarifying 
      bioavailability and evolution of activity of active ingredients in Pickering HIPEs 
      by oral administration, (2) constructing a Pickering interfacial catalysis platform 
      using protein colloidal particles, and (3) expanding the emerging applications of 
      Pickering HIPEs in fields, such as partially hydrogenated oil replacers, probiotic 
      encapsulation, and the template for porous materials.

TI  - Gelatin particle-stabilized high internal phase emulsions as nutraceutical 
      containers.
PG  - 13977-84
LID - 10.1021/am503341j [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we report for the first time the use of a well-dispersed gelatin 
      particle as a representative of natural and biocompatible materials to be an 
      effective particle stabilizer for high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) formulation. 
      Fairly monodispersed gelatin particles (â¼200 nm) were synthesized through a two-step 
      desolvation method and characterized by dynamic light scattering, Î¶-potential 
      measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Those 
      protein latexes were then used as sole emulsifiers to fabricate stable oil-in-water 
      Pickering HIPEs at different concentrations, pH conditions, and homogenization 
      times. Most of the gelatin particles were irreversibly adsorbed at the oil-water 
      interface to hinder droplet coalescence, such that Pickering HIPEs can be formed by 
      a small amount of gelatin particles (as low as 0.5 wt % in the water phase) at pH 
      far away from the isoelectric point of the gelatin particles. In addition, 
      increasing homogenization time led to narrow size distribution of droplets, and high 
      particle concentration resulted in more solidlike Pickering HIPEs. In vitro 
      controlled-release experiments revealed that the release of the encapsulated 
      Î²-carotene can be tuned by manipulating the concentration of gelatin particles in 
      the formulation, suggesting that the stable and narrow-size-distributed 
      gelatin-stabilized HIPEs had potential in functional food and pharmaceutical 
      applications.

TI  - Effect of a quality-controlled fermented nutraceutical on skin aging markers: An 
      antioxidant-control, double-blind study.
PG  - 909-916
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine whether oral supplementation with a 
      fermented papaya preparation (FPP-treated group) or an antioxidant cocktail 
      (antioxidant-control group, composed of 10 mg trans-resveratrol, 60 Âµg selenium, 10 
      mg vitamin E and 50 mg vitamin C) was able to improve the skin antioxidant capacity 
      and the expression of key skin genes, while promoting skin antiaging effects. The 
      study enrolled 60 healthy non-smoker males and females aged 40-65 years, all of whom 
      showed clinical signs of skin aging. The subjects were randomly divided into two 
      matched groups, and were administered FPP or antioxidant treatment of a 4.5 g/day 
      sachet sublingually twice a day for 90 days in a double-blind fashion. The 
      parameters investigated were: Skin surface, brown spots, skin evenness, skin 
      moisturization, elasticity (face), redox balance, nitric oxide (NO) concentration, 
      and the expression levels of key genes (outer forearm sample). As compared with the 
      baseline (day 0) and antioxidant-control values, FPP-treated subjects showed a 
      significant improvement in skin evenness, moisturization and elasticity. The two 
      treatments improved the MDA and SOD skin concentrations, but only the FPP-treated 
      group showed a higher SOD level and a significant NO increase, along with 
      significant upregulation of acquaporin-3 and downregulation of the potentially 
      pro-aging/carcinogenetic cyclophilin-A and CD147 genes (P<0.05). Progerin was 
      unaffected in both treatment groups. In conclusion, these findings suggest that 
      orally-administered FPP showed a consistent biological and gene-regulatory 
      improvement in the skin, as was also demonstrated in previous experimental and 
      clinical trials testing other tissues, while common oral antioxidants had only a 
      minor effect.

TI  - Development of anti-photo and anti-thermal high internal phase emulsions stabilized 
      by biomass lignin as a nutraceutical delivery system.
PG  - 355-365
LID - 10.1039/c8fo01981a [doi]
AB  - Herein, oil-in-water high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) were stabilized by lignin 
      from different technical resources with the assistance of alkyl polyglycoside (APG) 
      using an ultrasonic cavitation method. The results showed that the amphiphilicity of 
      lignin determined the formation of HIPEs. Microscopic and rheological 
      characterization indicated that the molecular weight and concentration of lignin, 
      the APG dosage and the oil/water ratio had important influences on the 
      microstructure and stability of the HIPEs. In addition, nutraceutical Î²-carotene 
      could be encapsulated in the oil phase of the HIPEs, which exhibited outstanding 
      protection against photo- and thermal-oxidative degradation of Î²-carotene. After 
      storage for 30 days under room temperature/light or storage for 7 days under 55 
      Â°C/dark conditions, the retention of Î²-carotene in the HIPEs was 87% to 95%, which 
      is significantly higher than that of Î²-carotene dispersed in bulk oil. In vitro 
      digestion experiments indicated that the digestibility of the HIPEs also markedly 
      improved. The largest release of free fatty acids was 80%. The bio-accessibility of 
      Î²-carotene in these lignin-based HIPEs also reached 60%.

AB  - Fifty-eight muscadine grape varieties were evaluated for their fruit quality, 
      nutraceutical, and antimicrobial properties during two growing seasons (2012 vs. 
      2013). Fruit quality was significantly different among muscadine grape varieties, 
      with weight ranged from 2.93 to 22.32g, pH from 3.01 to 3.84, titratable acidity 
      from 0.27% to 0.83%, and Â°Brix from 10.92 to 23.91. Total phenols for different 
      muscadine juices varied from 0.26 to 1.28mgGA/mL, skins from 10.13 to 30.02mgGA/g 
      DM, and seeds from 22.47 to 72.01mgGA/g DM. Accordingly, the antioxidant activity of 
      grape juices varied from 0.97 to 6.78mmolTrolox/mL, skins from 83.59 to 
      221.20Î¼molTrolox/g DM, and seeds from 178.22 to 619.73Î¼molTrolox/g DM. Study 
      demonstratedgrape seed polyphenols (MIC 54.8-60.1Î¼g/ml) showed stronger 
      antimicrobial activity against S. aureus than skin polyphenols (MIC 70.7-80.2Î¼g/ml). 
      This information could be a valuable asset in the research and extension of 
      muscadine grapes.

AB  - The physicochemical stability and in vitro bioaccessibility of Î²-carotene emulsions 
      stabilized by the whey protein isolate (WPI)-gum Acacia (GA) conjugates prepared by 
      dry-heating (Con WPI (D)) and ultrasound (Con WPI (U)) Maillard reaction were 
      investigated in this study. The conjugate-stabilized emulsions have a larger mean 
      size than the WPI-stabilized emulsion. The stability of emulsions under freeze-thaw 
      treatment, high ionic strength conditions, thermal treatment and pH conditions near 
      the isoelectric point of WPI were improved by glycation. The chemical stability of 
      Î²-carotene in emulsions was also enhanced by WPI-GA conjugates. The WPI-GA 
      conjugate-stabilized emulsions have better stability for droplet aggregation during 
      in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which increased Î²-carotene 
      bioaccessibility. However, the Con WPI (U)-stabilized emulsion shows poor thermal 
      stability and lower Î²-carotene bioaccessibility than the Con WPI (D)-stabilized 
      emulsion, which may be attributed to ultrasound-induced structural changes during 
      the process of glycation.

TI  - A new herb-drug interaction of Polygonum cuspidatum, a resveratrol-rich 
      nutraceutical, with carbamazepine in rats.

AB  - Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic with narrow therapeutic window, is a substrate 
      of CYP 3A which metabolizes CBZ to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE), an active 
      metabolite. This study investigated the acute and chronic effects of Polygonum 
      cuspidatum (PC), a resveratrol-rich nutraceutical, on the pharmacokinetics of CBZ in 
      rats and the underlying mechanisms. Rats were orally administered CBZ (200 mg/kg) 
      alone and coadministered with a single dose and the 7th dose of PC (2 g/kg) in a 
      crossover design. The concentrations of CBZ and CBZE in serum and various tissues 
      were determined by HPLC method. The results showed that PC significantly increased 
      the AUC(0-t) of CBZ and CBZE, whereas the formation rate of CBZE was decreased. 
      Tissue analysis showed that the concentrations of CBZ and CBZE in brain, liver and 
      kidney were significantly increased by PC. Cell studies indicated that the efflux 
      function of MRP 2 was inhibited by the serum metabolites of PC. In conclusion, PC 
      markedly increased the systemic exposure and brain concentration of CBZ and CBZE 
      through inhibiting the activities of CYP 3A and MRP 2.

AB  - 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) is an efficient Î±-glucosidase inhibitor (Î±-GI) with 
      potential applications in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In this study, 
      16 Bacillus strains were screened for Î±-GI rate, and the strain HZ-12 with the 
      highest Î±-GI rate was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens through the analysis 
      of physiological biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence. By LC-MS/Q-TOF 
      analysis, the Î±-GI component produced by B. amyloliquefaciens HZ-12 was identified 
      as DNJ. Soybean was used as the substrate for the solid-state fermentation; 
      870Â mg/kg DNJ was produced by B. amyloliquefaciens HZ-12 after optimizing the 
      fermentation conditions and media, which was 3.83-fold higher than the initial 
      yield. Also, evaluations of nutraceutical enrichment in the form of anticoagulant 
      activity, antioxidant activity, total nitrogen (TN), and total reducing sugars (TRS) 
      of the B. amyloliquefaciens HZ-12 fermented soybeans were substantially higher than 
      unfermented soybeans. This study provided a promising strain for high-level 
      production of DNJ and produced nutraceutical enriched soybeans by fermentation.

AB  - Anthocyanin-rich black rice extract powder (ABREP) as a nutraceutical source was 
      fortified into bread. The quality and digestibility behaviors of bread with ABREP 
      were evaluated through instrumental and in vitro digestion studies. The quality of 
      bread with 2% of ABREP was not significantly (p>0.05) different from the control 
      bread; however, increasing the ABREP level to 4% caused less elasticity and higher 
      density of bread. A mathematical model was further developed to systemically 
      describe the trajectory of bread digestion. The digestion rates of bread with ABREP 
      were found to be reduced by 12.8%, 14.1%, and 20.5% for bread with 1%, 2%, and 4% of 
      ABREP, respectively. Results of the study suggest that the fortification of 
      anthocyanins into bread could be an alternative way to produce functional bread with 
      a lower digestion rate and extra health benefits.

AB  - The upgrade of D-xylose, the most abundant pentose, to value-added biochemicals is 
      economically important to next-generation biorefineries. myo-Inositol, as vitamin 
      B8, has a six-carbon carbon-carbon ring. Here we designed an in vitro artificial 
      NAD(P)-free 12-enzyme pathway that can effectively convert the five-carbon xylose to 
      inositol involving xylose phosphorylation, carbon-carbon (C-C) rearrangement, C-C 
      bond circulation, and dephosphorylation. The reaction conditions catalyzed by all 
      thermostable enzymes from hyperthermophilic microorganisms Thermus thermophiles, 
      Thermotoga maritima, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus were optimized in reaction 
      temperature, buffer type and concentration, enzyme composition, Mg(2+) 
      concentration, and fed-batch addition of ATP. The 11-enzyme cocktail, whereas a 
      fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase from T. maritima has another function of inositol 
      monophosphatase, converted 20â¯mM xylose to 16.1â¯mM inositol with a conversion 
      efficiency of 96.6% at 70â¯Â°C. Polyphosphate was found to replace ATP for xylulose 
      phosphorylation due to broad substrate promiscuity of the T. maritima xylulokinase. 
      The Tris-HCl buffer effectively mitigated the Maillard reaction at 70â¯Â°C or higher 
      temperature. The co-production of value-added biochemicals, such as inositol, from 
      wood sugar could greatly improve economics of new biorefineries, similar to oil 
      refineries that make value-added plastic precursors to subsidize gasoline/diesel 
      production.

      lipid) were passed through simulated mouth (pH 6.8, 2 min), stomach (pH 2.5, 2 
      hours), and small intestine (pH 7.0, 2 hours) stages. After the small intestine 
      stage, the level of free fatty acids (FFAs) generated and the bioaccessibility of 
      curcumin were measured. The total amount of FFAs released significantly decreased 
      with increasing phytic acid level, from 105.7 Â± 5.9% (control) to 78.4 Â± 6.4% (0.5% 
      phytic acid). Conversely, curcumin bioaccessibility significantly increased from 
      39.4 Â± 3.5% (control) to 74.7 Â± 2.6% (0.5% phytic acid). The inverse relationship 
      between lipolysis and curcumin bioaccessibility was ascribed to the impact of phytic 
      acid on droplet flocculation and the level of free calcium ions present, which 
      affected the production of mixed micelles capable of solubilizing the nutraceutical. 
      The knowledge obtained here might prove beneficial for the employment of phytic acid 
      as a multifunctional ingredient that inhibits lipid digestion while boosting 
      nutraceutical bioavailability.

TI  - Designing excipient emulsions to increase nutraceutical bioavailability: emulsifier 
      type influences curcumin stability and bioaccessibility by altering gastrointestinal 
      fate.
PG  - 2475-86
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00606f [doi]
AB  - The influence of emulsifier type on the ability of excipient emulsions to improve 
      the solubility, stability, and bioaccessibility of powdered curcumin was examined. 
      Oil-in-water emulsions prepared using three different emulsifiers (whey protein 
      isolate, caseinate, or Tween 80) were mixed with curcumin powder and then incubated 
      at either 30 Â°C (to simulate applications of salad dressings) or 100 Â°C (to simulate 
      applications of cooking sauces). The transfer of curcumin into the excipient 
      emulsions was appreciably higher for excipient emulsions held at 100 Â°C than those 
      held at 30 Â°C, and was appreciably higher for surfactant-stabilized emulsions than 
      protein-stabilized emulsions. For example, the amounts of curcumin transferred into 
      emulsions held at 30 and 100 Â°C were 66 and 280 Î¼g mL(-1) for Tween 80, but only 17 
      and 208 Î¼g mL(-1) for caseinate. The total curcumin concentration in the digesta and 
      mixed micelle phases collected after excipient emulsions were exposed to a simulated 
      gastrointestinal tract (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) depended on emulsifier 
      type. The total amount of curcumin within the digesta was higher for 
      protein-stabilized emulsions than surfactant-stabilized ones, which was attributed 
      to the ability of the proteins to protect curcumin from chemical degradation. For 
      example, the digesta contained 204 Î¼g mL(-1) curcumin for caseinate emulsions, but 
      only 111 Î¼g mL(-1) for Tween 80 emulsions. This study shows the potential of 
      designing excipient emulsions to increase the oral bioavailability of curcumin for 
      food and pharmaceutical applications.

TI  - Enrichment of Bread with Nutraceutical-Rich Mushrooms: Impact of Auricularia 
      auricula (Mushroom) Flour Upon Quality Attributes of Wheat Dough and Bread.
PG  - 2041-2050
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.13812 [doi]
AB  - Edible mushrooms contain a variety of bioactive molecules that may enhance human 
      health and wellbeing. Consequently, there is increasing interest in fortifying 
      functional foods with these nutraceutical-rich substances. However, incorporation of 
      mushroom-based ingredients into foods should not adversely affect the quality 
      attributes of the final product. In this study, the impact of incorporating powdered 
      Auricularia auricula, a widely consumed edible mushroom, into bread products was 
      examined. The rheological and structural properties of wheat dough and bread 
      supplemented with 0% to 10% (w/w) A. auricula flour were measured. Supplementation 
      of wheat doughs with A. auricula flour increased the peak viscosity and enhanced 
      their water holding capacity. Rapid viscosity analysis showed that peak and final 
      viscosities of the blended flour (wheat flour with A. auricula flour) were higher 
      than wheat flour alone. However, dough stability and elastic modulus were reduced by 
      blending wheat flour with A. auricula flour. SEM observation showed that doughs with 
      up to 5% (w/w) A. auricula flour had acceptable gluten network microstructure. 
      Characterization of the quality attributes of bread indicated that incorporation of 
      A. auricula flour at levels >5% negatively impacted bread volume, height, texture, 
      and appearance.

AB  - Chemoresistance and development of relapses are ascribable to a rare cell population 
      of tumour mass: cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CSCs could increase patients' 
      survival rate and it is important to identify molecules that can act on the main 
      pathways of these cells. Natural bioactive compounds, of which Manuka honey (MH) is 
      rich, could be a good opportunity to target them. This work aims to evaluate the 
      effect of MH on CSCs-like from human colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116 cell line) 
      enriched through the in vitro sphere-forming assay. The results showed that MH 
      reduced the volume of the entire culture of spheroids, affecting also their 
      morphological parameters and induced apoptosis and ROS intracellular accumulation in 
      CSCs-like. In addition, MH decreased the mRNA expression of one of ABC transporters 
      (ABCG2) and affected self-renewal ability through the downregulation of the mRNA 
      expression of one of the receptor membranes of Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway (Frizzled 7).

TI  - Enhancement of Nutraceutical Bioavailability using Excipient Nanoemulsions: Role of 
      Lipid Digestion Products on Bioaccessibility of Carotenoids and Phenolics from 
      Mangoes.
PG  - N754-61
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.13227 [doi]
AB  - The ability of excipient nanoemulsions to increase the bioaccessibility of different 
      kinds of nutraceuticals (phenolics and carotenoids) in mangoes was studied. 
      Oil-in-water excipient nanoemulsions containing small digestible lipid nanoparticles 
      (d < 200 nm) were prepared using different oil phases: medium chain triglycerides 
      (MCT) and long-chain triglycerides (LCT). These nanoemulsions were then mixed with 
      pureed mango and passed through a simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT): mouth, 
      stomach, and small intestine. Carotenoid bioaccessibility decreased in the following 
      order: LCT nanoemulsions > MCT nanoemulsions > buffer solution, which was attributed 
      to differences in the solubilization capacity of the mixed micelles generated in the 
      intestinal fluids. The digestion products of LCT formed mixed micelles with 
      hydrophobic domains large enough to accommodate the carotenoids, whereas those of 
      MCT did not. Excipient emulsions had much less effect on phenolic bioaccessibility, 
      which may be because phenolics are smaller more polar molecules and are therefore 
      more easily solubilized in aqueous intestinal fluids. These results highlight the 
      potential of excipient nanoemulsions in boosting the bioavailability of lipophilic 
      bioactive agents in fruits and vegetables.

TI  - Iron supplementation in young iron-deficient females causes gastrointestinal redox 
      imbalance: protective effect of a fermented nutraceutical.
PG  - 53-63
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess whether the concomitant supplementation of 
      certified fermented papaya preparation (FPP, ORI, Gifu, Japan) together with iron 
      supplementation could beneficially affect lipid peroxidation either systemically and 
      at a intraluminal gut level in women with low iron stores. Treatment compliance and 
      iron absorption was assessed as well. Fifty-two non-pregnant, fertile, non-smokers, 
      healthy women with iron deficiency were recruited. The women were given iron 
      supplements (100 mg Fe/d as ferrous sulfate) to be taken daily for 12 weeks (group 
      A). Group B patients were also supplemented with 6g/day of a FPP. A detailed life 
      style questionnaire was administered to all subjects. Iron, ferritin, transferrin 
      receptors (Tf R) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma were measured. The RBCs lysate 
      was used for the estimation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase 
      (GPx). The total and free iron concentration as well as analysis of oxidative stress 
      in the feces was measured. FPP-supplemented subjects showed a significantly lower 
      degree of gastrointestinal discomfort (p less than 0.05) and abolished the iron 
      supplementation-induced increase of MDA (p less than 0.001) and the depletion of SOD 
      and GPx (p less than 0.01). Moreover, the nutraceutical co-administration brought 
      about a significant reduction of gut oxidative damage and lower fecal content of 
      either total and free iron (p less than 0.05 vs group A). Overall, group B showed a 
      better TfR/ferritin ratio response (p less than 0.05 vs group A). While iron 
      supplementation maintains its clinical relevance considering the prevalence of iron 
      deficiency among females, a careful clinical evaluation and a protective 
      nutraceutical co-administration, as our data suggest with FPP, should be considered.

AB  - Pickering high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) stabilized solely by bioderived 
      starch-based particles hold potential for application in the food and pharmaceutical 
      fields. This paper reports the use of a thermoresponsive 2-hydroxy-3-butoxypropyl 
      starch (HBPS) particle as a representative natural biocompatible material for use as 
      an effective stabilizer for HIPE formation. HBPS is synthesized by using butyl 
      glycidyl ether as a hydrophobic reagent to change the hydrophobic-hydrophilic 
      balance of starch, and then starch-based particles are fabricated by a simple 
      nanoprecipitation procedure. The size of particles increased with an increase in 
      temperature, and the particles are essentially monodisperse with a PDI of about 0.1 
      when the temperature was above 15Â Â°C. These HBPS particles were subsequently used as 
      an effective stabilizer to fabricate stable oil-in-water (o/w) Pickering HIPEs with 
      an internal phase volume of 80% at different stabilizer concentrations. The results 
      demonstrated that increasing the particle concentration is conducive to the 
      formation of stable Pickering HIPEs with greater stiffnesses. In addition, the 
      nutraceutical material (Î²-carotene) was encapsulated into HIPEs and in vitro release 
      experiments revealed that the release in this system can be controlled by adjusting 
      the temperature.

TI  - Utilizing food matrix effects to enhance nutraceutical bioavailability: increase of

AB  - Excipient foods have compositions and structures specifically designed to improve 
      the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents present in other foods coingested with 
      them. In this study, an excipient emulsion was shown to improve the solubility and 
      bioaccessibility of curcumin from powdered rhizome turmeric (Curcuma longa). Corn 
      oil-in-water emulsions were mixed with curcumin powder, and the resulting mixtures 
      were incubated at either 30 Â°C (to simulate a salad dressing) or 100 Â°C (to simulate 
      a cooking sauce). There was an appreciable transfer of curcumin into the excipient 
      emulsions at both incubation temperatures, but this effect was much more pronounced 
      at 100 Â°C. The bioaccessibility of curcumin measured using a simulated 
      gastrointestinal tract model was greatly improved in the presence of the excipient 
      emulsion, particularly in the system held at 100 Â°C. This effect was attributed to 
      the higher initial amount of curcumin solubilized within the oil droplets, as well 
      as that solubilized in the mixed micelles formed by lipid digestion. This study 
      highlights the potential of designing excipient food emulsions that increase the 
      oral bioavailability of lipophilic nutraceuticals, such as curcumin.

AB  - We report the application of Vitamin D3 (VD(3)) in nanoparticles of oleoyl alginate 
      ester (OAE)(OAE-VD(3)). The internalization of fluorescent OAE-VD(3) by Caco-2 cells 
      was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In vivo pharmacokinetic 
      studies showed that incorporation into OAE nanoparticles resulted in increased 
      absorption of VD(3). Its application in the treatment of rickets was assayed using a 
      model of nutritionally induced vitamin D-deficiency rickets. The results showed that 
      the encapsulated VD(3) had better efficacy than that of the free drug in vivo. Our 
      studies provide evidence that OAE nanoparticles are valuable as nutraceutical 
      delivery vehicles to enhance the absorption of VD(3).

TI  - An aqueous extract of the popular Chinese nutraceutical Kwei Ling Ko (Tortoise 
      shell-Rhizome jelly) activates the PPARgamma pathway and down-regulates the NFkappaB 
      activity.
PG  - 748-59
AB  - It is generally believed that the popular nutraceutical 'Kwei Ling Ko' (KLK; 
      Tortoise shell-Rhizome jelly) has antiinflammatory effects, but the mechanism by 
      which its effects are manifested remains unknown. Peroxisome proliferation-activated 
      receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor/transcription factor 
      superfamily with multiple roles in adipocyte differentiation, glucose homeostasis, 
      immunomodulation and antiinflammatory regulation. As PPAR is required for adipocyte 
      induction, we used adipogenesis as a possible screen for the activation of the PPAR 
      pathway. Interestingly, an aqueous extract of KLK (sKLK) was able to induce the 
      adipocyte differentiation of fibroblast cell lines. Adipogenesis was confirmed by 
      flow cytometric analysis using a fluorescent lipid stain. Up-regulation of PPARgamma 
      transcripts during adipogenesis was also demonstrated by reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sKLK-induced adipogenesis was 
      similar to that elicited by insulin. The activity of nuclear factor-kappaB 
      (NFkappaB), a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of proinflammatory 
      genes, was also down-regulated in response to sKLK. Luciferase reporter gene assays 
      further demonstrated that sKLK inhibited both basal and tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha-stimulated NFkappaB activation. The activities reported in this study 
      support an immunomodulatory effect for sKLK. As activation of PPAR pathway has a 
      dual role in adipogenesis and anti-inflammation, our observations are consistent 
      with the notion that KLK possesses antiinflammatory properties.
