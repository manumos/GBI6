AB  - The average human life expectancy has increased globally, and continues to rise, 
      owing to the substantive progress made in healthcare, medicine, sanitation, housing 
      and education. This ultimately enriches society with a greater proportion of elderly 
      people. Sustaining a healthy aged population is key to diminish the societal and 
      economic impact of age-related infirmities. This is especially challenging because 
      tissue function, and thus wellbeing, naturally progressively decline as humans age. 
      With age increasing the risk of developing diseases, one of the therapeutic options 
      is to interfere with the molecular and cellular pathways involved in age-related 
      tissue dysfunction, which is in part caused by the accumulation of senescent cells. 
      One strategy to prevent this could be using drugs that selectively kill these cells 
      (senolytics). In parallel, some compounds have been identified that prevent or slow 
      down the progression of senescence or some of its features (senostatics). Senolytic 
      and senostatic therapies have been shown to be efficient in vivo, but they also have 
      unwanted dose-dependent side effects, including toxicity. Important advances might 
      be made using bioactive compounds from plants and foods (nutraceuticals) if, as is 
      proposed, they offer similar effectiveness with fewer side effects. The focus of 
      this review is on the use of nutraceuticals in interfering with cellular senescence.

AB  - The full exploration of the 'nutraceuticals' therapeutic potential in cosmetics has 
      been hindered by their poor stratum corneum permeation. Therefore, the aim of the 
      present study was to formulate a nutraceutical; quercetin, in novel vitamin C based 
      nanovesicles (aspasomes), and to explore their beneficial effects in the treatment 
      of acne. Aspasomes were characterized for their particle size, zeta potential, 
      entrapment efficiency (EE%), 3-months storage stability, skin deposition/permeation, 
      antioxidant potential, and morphology. Aspasomes antibacterial efficacy on 
      Propionibacterium acnes using the zone of inhibition assay was also tested, whilst 
      their safety on skin fibroblastic cells was assessed in vitro using 3T3 CCL92 cell 
      lines. An exploratory clinical trial was conducted in acne patients, and the 
      percentage reduction of inflammatory, non-inflammatory and total acne lesions was 
      taken as the evaluation criterion. Results revealed that quercetin-loaded aspasomes 
      displayed a desirable nanometer size (125-184 nm), negative charge with good storage 
      stability, and high skin deposition reaching 40%. Aspasomes managed to preserve the 
      antioxidant activity of quercetin, and exhibited a significantly higher 
      antibacterial effect (15 ± 1.53 mm) against Propionibacterium acnes than quercetin 
      alone (8.25 ± 2.08 mm), and were safe on skin fibroblastic cells. Upon clinical 
      examination in 20 acne patients (14 females, 6 males), quercetin aspasomes exhibited 
      reduction percentages of 77.9%, 11.8% and 55.3% for inflammatory lesions, comedones 
      and total lesions respectively. This opens vast applications of the presented 
      formulation in the treatment of other oxidative skin diseases, and delineates the 
      nutraceuticals and nanoformulations prepared from natural materials as promising 
      dermatological treatment modes.

TI  - Nutraceutical therapies for degenerative joint diseases: a critical review.
PG  - 145-64
AB  - There is growing recognition of the importance of nutritional factors in the 
      maintenance of bone and joint health, and that nutritional imbalance combined with 
      endocrine abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) 
      and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). Despite this, dietary programs have played a 
      secondary role in the management of these connective tissue disorders. Articular 
      cartilage is critically dependent upon the regular provision of nutrients (glucose 
      and amino acids), vitamins (particularly vitamin C), and essential trace elements 
      (zinc, magnesium, and copper). Therefore, dietary supplementation programs and 
      nutraceuticals used in conjunction with non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) may offer significant benefits to patients with joint disorders, such as OA 
      and OCD. This article examines the available clinical evidence for the efficacy of 
      nutraceuticals, antioxidant vitamin C, polyphenols, essential fatty acids, and 
      mineral cofactors in the treatment of OA and related joint disorders in humans and 
      veterinary species. This article also attempts to clarify the current state of 
      knowledge. It also highlights the need for additional targeted research to elucidate 
      the changes in nutritional status and potential alterations to the expression of 
      plasma membrane transport systems in synovial structures in pathophysiological 
      states, so that current therapy and future treatments may be better focused.

AB  - In the cosmeceutical field, it is essential to develop topical delivery systems 
      which would allow drugs to create a depot and permeate within the skin. The aim of 
      the present study was to develop composite nanofibers of polyvinyl 
      alcohol/quercetin/essential oils using the electrospinning technique, and assess 
      their efficiency in acne alleviation. Quercetin was chosen due to its 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antibacterial activities. Nanofibers were 
      characterized for their morphology, ex-vivo deposition/permeation, 
      physical/mechanical integrity, thermal properties, and chemical characteristics. In 
      addition, the anti-bacterial efficacy was tested on Propionibacterium acne (P. 
      acne), and a cytotoxicity assay was carried out. Lastly, an experimental clinical 
      trial was conducted on acne patients, where the percentage reduction of 
      inflammatory, non-inflammatory and total acne lesions was taken as evaluation 
      criterion. Results showed that quercetin was successfully loaded into the nanofibers 
      which were homogenously dispersed. They showed a reasonable skin deposition 
      percentage of 28.24% ± 0.012, a significantly higher antibacterial efficacy against 
      Propionibacterium acne than quercetin alone, and were utterly safe on skin 
      fibroblastic cells. Upon clinical examination on acne patients, the nanofibers 
      showed 61.2%, 14.7%, and 52.9% reduction of inflammatory, comedonal, and total acne 
      lesions respectively, suggesting a promising topical anti-acne delivery system.

AB  - In this study, enteric coatings based exclusively on naturally occurring ingredients 
      were reported. Alginate (Alg) and pectin (Pec) blends with or without naturally 
      occurring glyceride, glycerol monostearate (GMS), were initially used to produce 
      solvent-casted films. Incorporating GMS in the natural polymeric films significantly 
      enhanced the acid-resistance properties in gastric medium. Theophylline tablets 
      coated with Alg-Pec blends without GMS disintegrated shortly after incubation in 
      gastric medium (pH 1.2), leading to a premature and complete release of 
      theophylline. Interestingly, tablets coated with Alg-Pec blends that contain the 
      natural glyceride (GMS) resisted the gastric environment for 2 h with minimal drug 
      release (<5%) and disintegrated rapidly following introduction to the intestinal 
      medium, allowing a fast and complete drug release. Furthermore, the coating system 
      proved to be stable for six months under accelerated conditions. These findings are 
      particularly appealing to nutraceutical industry as they provide the foundation to 
      produce naturally-occurring GRAS based enteric coatings.

AB  - The use of naturally derived excipients to develop enteric coatings offers 
      significant advantages over conventional synthetic polymers. Unlike synthetic 
      polymers, they are biodegradable, relatively abundant, have no daily intake limits 
      or restrictions on use for dietary and nutraceutical products. However, little 
      information is available on their dissolution properties under different 
      gastrointestinal conditions and in comparison to each other. This work investigated 
      the gastric resistance properties of commercially available GRAS-based coating 
      technologies. Three coating systems were evaluated: ethyl cellulose+carboxymethyl 
      cellulose (EC-CMC), ethyl cellulose+sodium alginate (EC-Alg) and shellac+sodium 
      alginate (Sh-Alg) combinations. The minimum coating levels were optimized to meet 
      USP pharmacopoeial criteria for delayed release formulations (<10% release after 2h 
      in pH 1.2 followed by >80% release after 45 min of pH change). Theophylline 150 mg 
      tablets were coated with 6.5%, 7%, and 2.75% coating levels of formulations EC-CMC, 
      EC-Alg and Sh-Alg, respectively. In vitro dissolution test revealed a fast release 
      in pH 6.8 for ethyl cellulose based coatings: t80% value of 65 and 45 min for EC-CMC 
      and EC-Alg respectively, while a prolonged drug release from Sh-Alg coating was 
      observed in both pH 6.8 and 7.4 phosphate buffers. However, when more biologically 
      relevant bicarbonate buffer was used, all coatings showed slower drug release. 
      Disintegration test, carried out in both simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, 
      confirmed good mechanical resistance of EC-CMC and EC-Alg coating, and revealed poor 
      durability of the thinner Sh-Alg. Under elevated gastric pH conditions (pH 2, 3 and 
      4), EC-CMC and EC-Alg coatings were broken after 70, 30, 55 min and after 30, 15, 15 
      min, respectively, while Sh-Alg coated tablets demonstrated gastric resistance at 
      all pH values. In conclusion, none of the GRAS-grade coatings fully complied with 
      the different biological demands of delayed release coating systems.

AB  - The generation of camel milk derived bioactive peptides (CM-BAPs) have started to 
      grab keen interest of many researchers during the past decade. CM-BAPs have shown 
      more significant bioactive properties in comparison to camel milk intact proteins. 
      CM-BAPs can be obtained using enzyme hydrolysis to form hydrolysates, or by the 
      fermentation process. In this systematic review, 46 research articles exploring the 
      health-related bioactive properties of CM-BAPs through in-vitro and in-vivo studies 
      have been included. CM-BAPs have been reported for their antioxidant, anti-diabetic, 
      anti-obesity, antihypertensive, antibacterial, antibiofilm, anticancer, 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-haemolytic, and anti-hyperpigmentation activities. The 
      effects of factors such as molecular weight of peptides, type of enzyme, enzyme to 
      substrate ratio, hydrolysis temperature and duration have been analysed. The 
      in-vitro studies have provided enough evidence on certain aspects of the 
      pharmacological actives of camel milk bioactive peptides. Nevertheless, the in-vivo 
      studies are very limited, and no clinical studies on CM-BAPs have been reported.

AB  - Few studies have examined the effect of dietary restriction in horses with equine 
      metabolic syndrome (EMS). This study aimed to determine improvements in insulin 
      sensitivity following dietary restriction for 6 weeks, and to determine if the 
      improvement would be greater in horses receiving short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides 
      (sc-FOS). Dietary management involved feeding grass hay, restricted to 1.25% of body 
      mass (BM) as daily dry matter intake and soaked in cold water prior to feeding, with 
      the addition of a vitamin and mineral nutraceutical supplement with or without the 
      addition of sc-FOS (10 g/100 kg). Soaking the hay resulted in a significant 
      reduction in non-structural carbohydrates (38%, P = 0.01), digestible energy (6.78%, 
      P = 0.01) and water soluble minerals. Following 6 weeks of dietary restriction with 
      soaked grass hay and nutraceutical supplement, horses lost an average of 6.8% BM and 
      showed reductions in body condition score (BCS) and belly circumference. Sensitivity 
      to insulin improved overall, as determined by the total insulin response during the 
      combined glucose insulin test. The magnitude of improvement in insulin sensitivity 
      was associated with the degree of insulin resistance recorded at outset, and the 
      extent of overall losses in BM and BCS, but was independent of the addition of 
      sc-FOS. The nutraceutical supplement was highly palatable and no adverse effects 
      were noted. From the findings of this study a strict dietary program in combination 
      with a specifically designed vitamin and mineral nutraceutical supplement can be 
      recommended to obtain rapid improvements in BM, BCS and insulin sensitivity of 
      animals presenting with EMS.

TI  - Physical Activity as a Predictor of Clinical Trial Outcomes in Bipolar Depression: A 
      Subanalysis of a Mitochondrial-Enhancing Nutraceutical Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 306-318
LID - 10.1177/0706743719889547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) generally engage in low levels of 
      physical activity (PA), and yet few studies have investigated the relationship 
      between PA and change in BD symptom severity. The aim of this subanalysis of an 
      adjunctive nutraceutical randomized controlled trial for the treatment of bipolar 
      depression was to explore the relationship between PA, the active adjunctive 
      treatments (a nutraceutical "mitochondrial cocktail"), and clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: Participants with bipolar depression were randomized to receive 
      N-acetylcysteine alone, N-acetylcysteine with a combination of nutraceuticals 
      (chosen for the potential to increase mitochondrial activity), or placebo for 16 
      weeks. Participants (n = 145) who completed the International Physical Activity 
      Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF; measured at Week 4) were included in this 
      exploratory subanalysis. Assessments of BD symptoms, functioning, and quality of 
      life were completed at monthly visits up until Week 20. Generalised Estimating 
      Equations were used to explore whether IPAQ-SF scores were a moderator of treatment 
      received on outcomes of the study. RESULTS: Week-4 PA was not related to changes in 
      Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores across the study until Week 20. 
      However, participants who engaged in more PA and who received the combination 
      treatment were more likely to have a reduction in scores on the Bipolar Depression 
      Rating Scale (P = 0.03). However, this was not consistent in all domains explored 
      using the IPAQ-SF. Participants who engaged in higher levels of PA also experienced 
      greater improvement in social and occupational functioning and less impairment in 
      functioning due to their psychopathology and improvement in quality of life at Week 
      20, irrespective of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence of 
      the association between PA and reduction in BD symptoms in a nutraceutical clinical 
      trial. However, further research assessing the potential synergistic effects of PA 
      in BD is required.
