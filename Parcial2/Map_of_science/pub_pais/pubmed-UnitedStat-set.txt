AB  - Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) enriched in 
      phospholipids in the brain and retina, is known to play multi-functional roles in 
      brain health and diseases. While arachidonic acid (AA) is released from membrane 
      phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), DHA is linked to action of 
      the Ca(2+)-independent iPLA2. DHA undergoes enzymatic conversion by 15-lipoxygenase 
      (Alox 15) to form oxylipins including resolvins and neuroprotectins, which are 
      powerful lipid mediators. DHA can also undergo non-enzymatic conversion by reacting 
      with oxygen free radicals (ROS), which cause the production of 4-hydoxyhexenal 
      (4-HHE), an aldehyde derivative which can form adducts with DNA, proteins and 
      lipids. In studies with both animal models and humans, there is evidence that 
      inadequate intake of maternal n-3 PUFA may lead to aberrant development and function 
      of the central nervous system (CNS). What is less certain is whether consumption of 
      n-3 PUFA is important in maintaining brain health throughout one's life span. 
      Evidence mostly from non-human studies suggests that DHA intake above normal 
      nutritional requirements might modify the risk/course of a number of diseases of the 
      brain. This concept has fueled much of the present interest in DHA research, in 
      particular, in attempts to delineate mechanisms whereby DHA may serve as a 
      nutraceutical and confer neuroprotective effects. Current studies have revealed 
      ability for the oxylipins to regulation of cell redox homeostasis through the 
      Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/Antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) 
      anti-oxidant pathway, and impact signaling pathways associated with 
      neurotransmitters, and modulation of neuronal functions involving brain-derived 
      neurotropic factor (BDNF). This review is aimed at describing recent studies 
      elaborating these mechanisms with special regard to aging and Alzheimer's disease, 
      autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore relationships between protein, oil, and seed 
      weight with seed nutraceutical composition, focused on total isoflavone (TI) and 
      total tocopherol (TT) contents across genotypic and environmental combinations in 
      soybean. We conducted a synthesis-analysis of peer-reviewed published field studies 
      reporting TI, TT, protein, oil, and seed weight (n = 1,908). The main outcomes from 
      this synthesis-analysis were: (i) relationship of TI-to-protein concentration was 
      positive, though for the upper boundary, TI decreases with increases in protein; 
      (ii) relationship of TT-to-oil concentration was positive, but inconsistent when oil 
      was expressed in mg per seed; and (iii) as seed weight increased, TI accumulation 
      was less than proportional relative to protein concentration and TT decreased more 
      proportional relative to oil concentration. Association between nutraceuticals and 
      protein, oil, and seed weight for soybean reported in the present study can be used 
      as a foundational knowledge for soybean breeding programs interested on predicting 
      and selecting enhanced meal isoflavone and/or oil tocopherol contents.

AB  - Vascular biology, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle and cardiac dysfunction 
      play a primary role in the initiation and perpetuation of hypertension, 
      cardiovascular disease and target organ damage. Nutrient-gene interactions and 
      epigenetics are predominant factors in promoting beneficial or detrimental effects 
      in cardiovascular health and hypertension. Macronutrients and micronutrients can 
      prevent, control and treat hypertension through numerous mechanisms related to 
      vascular biology. Oxidative stress, inflammation and autoimmune dysfunction initiate 
      and propagate hypertension and cardiovascular disease. There is a role for the 
      selected use of single and component nutraceutical supplements, vitamins, 
      antioxidants and minerals in the treatment of hypertension based on scientifically 
      controlled studies which complement optimal nutrition, coupled with other lifestyle 
      modifications.

AB  - Nutritional supplementations are a form of nutrition sources that may help in 
      improving the health complexities of a person throughout his or her life span. Being 
      also categorized as food supplementations, nutraceuticals are products that are 
      extracted from edible sources with medical benefits as well as primary nutritional 
      values. Nutraceuticals can be considered as functional foods. There are evidences 
      that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help 
      to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in 
      adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], 
      Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II 
      diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the 
      complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing 
      enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as 
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic 
      modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and 
      management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific 
      overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical 
      supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above 
      non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall 
      introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery 
      systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.

LID - 24
AB  - Abscisic acid is naturally present in fruits and vegetables, and it plays an 
      important role in managing glucose homeostasis in humans. According to the latest 
      U.S. dietary survey, about 92% of the population might have a deficient intake of 
      ABA due to their deficient intake of fruits and vegetables. This review summarizes 
      the in vitro, preclinical, mechanistic, and human translational findings obtained 
      over the past 15 years in the study of the role of ABA in glycemic control. In 2007, 
      dietary ABA was first reported to ameliorate glucose tolerance and obesity-related 
      inflammation in mice. The most recent findings regarding the topic of ABA and its 
      proposed receptor lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 in glycemic control and their 
      interplay with insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 suggest a major role for ABA in 
      the physiological response to a glucose load in humans. Moreover, emerging evidence 
      suggests that the ABA response might be dysfunctional in diabetic subjects. Follow 
      on intervention studies in healthy individuals show that low-dose dietary ABA 
      administration exerts a beneficial effect on the glycemia and insulinemia profiles 
      after oral glucose load. These recent findings showing benefits in humans, together 
      with extensive efficacy data in mouse models of diabetes and inflammatory disease, 
      suggest the need for reference ABA values and its possible exploitation of the 
      glycemia-lowering effects of ABA for preventative purposes. Larger clinical studies 
      on healthy, prediabetic, and diabetic subjects are needed to determine whether 
      addressing the widespread dietary ABA deficiency improves glucose control in humans.

AB  - Maianthemum atropurpureum (Franch) LaFrankie (Asparagaceae), called nibai in Tibetan 
      or dongka in Drung or zhu-ye-cai in local Chinese, is a wild vegetable consumed by 
      the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in Northwest Yunnan, China. It is also a 
      traditional medicinal plant used by different linguistic groups for antimicrobial 
      purposes. However the nutritional and phytochemical compositions of this important 
      medicinal food plant have not been well studied previously. In this study, the 
      nutrient content for nibai was determined by the China National Standards (GB) 
      methods, and the phytochemical analysis involved multiple chromatographic and 
      spectral methods including LC-TOF-MS analysis. Dried nibai is a rich source of 
      protein (ca. 24.6%), with 18 of the 21 common amino acids. The amino acid content of 
      nibai can reach up to 17.9/100 g, with the essential amino acids as major 
      contributors, corresponding to 42.3% of the total amino acids. Nibai contains rich 
      mineral elements, dietary fiber, vitamins, β-carotene, carbohydrates, and lipids. 
      The phytochemical content of nibai was examined by conventional isolation 
      strategies, as well as HR-ESI-TOF-MS to detect and identify 16 compounds including 
      nine steroid saponins and seven flavonoids. Among these compounds, uridine, 
      adenosine, guanosine, and β-methyl-6-methyl-d-glucopyranoside were found from the 
      genus Maianthemum for the first time. These results help to demonstrate that the 
      local people's practice of consuming Maianthemum atropurpureum is reasonable due to 
      its high levels of vitamins, minerals, essential amino-acids, and phytochemicals. 
      Nibai may be further developed in Tibet and surrounding regions, and beyond as a 
      health food, nutraceutical, and/or dietary supplement product.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Fate of Fluid and Gelled Nutraceutical Emulsions: Impact on

AB  - Fluid and gelled nutraceutical emulsions were formulated from quercetin-loaded 
      caseinate-stabilized emulsions by the addition of gellan gum with or without 
      acidification with glucono-δ-lactone. Gellan gum addition increased the viscosity or 
      gel strength of the fluid and gelled emulsions, respectively. The behavior of the 
      nutraceutical emulsions in a simulated gastrointestinal tract depended upon their 
      initial composition. Fluid emulsions containing different gellan gum levels (0-0.2%) 
      had similar protein and lipid hydrolysis rates as well as similar quercetin 
      bioaccessibility (∼51%). Conversely, proteolysis, lipolysis, and quercetin 
      bioaccessibility decreased with an increasing gellan gum level in the gelled 
      emulsions. In comparison to gelled emulsions, fluid emulsions were digested more 
      rapidly and led to higher quercetin bioaccessibility. There was a good correlation 
      between quercetin bioaccessibility and the lipolysis rate. These findings are useful 
      for designing nutraceutical-loaded emulsions that can be used in a wide range of 
      food products with different rheological properties.

AB  - Nutraceuticals can serve as an alternative supplement to overcome nutritional 
      deficiency for a healthy lifestyle. They can also play a key role in disease 
      management. To develop carrot nutraceutical products, 64 genotypes from four 
      different continents were evaluated for a range of morpho-nutrition variables. 
      Genetic variability, heritability, strength and direction of association among 
      variables, and direct and indirect relationships among physiochemical and 
      nutritional traits with β-carotene content were evaluated. Core diameter, foliage 
      weight, root weight and shoulder weight showed significant association with 
      β-carotene accumulation. Principal component analysis for physiochemical and 
      nutritional assessment divided these genotypes into two distinctive groups, Eastern 
      carrots and Western carrots. Caloric and moisture content had high positive 
      associations with β-carotene content while carbohydrate content was negatively 
      associated. Five genotypes (T-29, PI 634658, PI 288765, PI 164798, and Ames 25043) 
      with the highest β-carotene contents were selected for making three nutraceutical 
      supplements (carrot-orange juice, carrot jam and carrot candies). These 
      nutraceutical supplements retained high β-carotene content coupled with antioxidant 
      properties. Carrot jam (6.5 mg/100 g) and carrot candies (4.8 mg/100 g) had greater 
      concentrations of β-carotene than carrot-orange juice (1.017 mg/100 g). Carrot jam 
      presented high antioxidant activity with the highest values in T-29 (39% inhibition 
      of oxidation) followed by PI 634658 (37%), PI 164798 (36.5%), Ames 25043 (36%) and 
      PI 288765 (35.5%). These nutraceutical products, with 4-6.5 mg/100 g β-carotene 
      content, had higher values than the USDA recommended dietary intake of 3-6 mg 
      β-carotene/day can be recommended for daily use to lower the risk of chronic 
      disease.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an essential source of food proteins and an 
      important component of sustainable agriculture systems around the world. Thus, 
      conserving and exploiting the genetic materials of this crop species play an 
      important role in achieving global food safety and security through the preservation 
      of functional and serependic opportunities afforded by plant species diversity. Our 
      research aimed to collect and perform agronomic, morpho-phenological, 
      molecular-genetic, and nutraceutical characterizations of common bean accessions, 
      including lowland and mountain Venetian niche landraces (ancient farmer populations) 
      and Italian elite lineages (old breeder selections). Molecular characterization with 
      SSR and SNP markers grouped these accessions into two well-separated clusters that 
      were linked to the original Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools, which was consistent 
      with the outputs of ancestral analysis. Genetic diversity in the two main clusters 
      was not distributed equally the Andean gene pool was found to be much more uniform 
      than the Mesoamerican pool. Additional subdivision resulted in subclusters, 
      supporting the existence of six varietal groups. Accessions were selected according 
      to preliminary investigations and historical records and cultivated in two 
      contrasting Venetian environments: sea-level and mountain territories. We found that 
      the environment significantly affected some nutraceutical properties of the seeds, 
      mainly protein and starch contents. The antioxidant capacity was found significantly 
      greater at sea level for climbing accessions and in the mountains for dwarf 
      accessions. The seed yield at sea level was halved than mountain due to a seeds 
      reduction in weight, volume, size and density. At sea level, bean landraces tended 
      to have extended flowering periods and shorter fresh pod periods. The seed yield was 
      positively correlated with the length of the period during which plants had fresh 
      pods and negatively correlated with the length of the flowering period. Thus, the 
      agronomic performance of these genetic resources showed their strong connection and 
      adaptation to mountainous environments. On the whole, the genetic-molecular 
      information put together for these univocal bean entries was combined with overall 
      results from plant and seed analyses to select and transform the best accessions 
      into commercial varieties (i.e., pure lines) suitable for wider cultivation.

      Supplementation in Reducing Age-Related Sarcopenia.
PG  - 94-104
LID - 10.2174/1874609814666210203090458 [doi]
AB  - Sarcopenia is a commonly prevalent geriatric condition mainly characterized by 
      progressive loss of the skeletal muscle mass that results in noticeably reduced 
      muscle strength and quality. Most of the geriatric population above 60 years of age 
      are overweight, leading to the accumulation of fat in the muscles resulting in 
      abated muscle function. The increased loss of muscle mass is associated with high 
      rates of disability, poor motility, frailty and mortality. The excessive 
      degeneration of muscles is now also being observed in middle-aged people. Therefore, 
      geriatrics has recently started shifting towards the identification of early stages 
      of the disability in order to expand the life span of the patient and reduce 
      physical dependence. Recent findings have indicated that patients with increased 
      physical activity are also affected by sarcopenia, therefore indicating the role of 
      nutritional supplements to enhance muscle health which in turn helps to counteract 
      sarcopenia. Various interventions with physical training have not provided 
      substantial improvements to this disorder, thereby highlighting the crucial role of 
      nutritional supplementation in enhancing muscle mass and strength. Nutritional 
      supplementation has not only been shown to enhance the positive effects of physical 
      interventions but also have a profound impact on the gut microbiome that has come 
      forward as a key regulator of muscle mass and function. This brief review throws 
      light upon the efficiency of nutrients and nutraceutical supplementation by 
      highlighting their ancillary effects in physical interventions as well as improving 
      the gut microbiome status in sarcopenic adults, thereby giving rise to a multimodal 
      intervention for the treatment of sarcopenia.

AB  - The primary driving force in preeclampsia (PE) appears to be excessive secretion of 
      fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), a truncated decoy receptor for vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) that induces 
      systemic endotheliopathy by depriving endothelial cells of the trophic support 
      conferred by VEGF. Factors which boost placental sFlt-1 production in PE include 
      hypoxia - reflecting improper placentation - oxidative stress, and deficient 
      production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Nutraceutical measures which may address these 
      issues include taurine and N-acetylcysteine - which may boost placental H2S 
      production; spirulina and phase 2 inducers of heme oxygenase-1 such as lipoic acid - 
      which may down-regulate placental NADPH oxidase activity; and citrulline, high-dose 
      folate, and dietary nitrate - which by supporting placental nitric oxide production 
      may aid proper placentation and hence prevent placental hypoxia. These agents may 
      also help to alleviate the pathogenic impact of sFlt-1 excess. If the utility of 
      such measures can be demonstrated in rodent models of PE, functional foods 
      incorporating these nutraceuticals can be envisioned as aids to a healthful 
      pregnancy. Moreover, rodent studies suggest that such prenatal supplementation may 
      reduce risk for hypertension in adult offspring of the pregnancy. And, since women 
      who develop PE are at markedly higher risk for cardiovascular disorders in their 
      later life, continuing use of such supplementation - promoting effective NO and H2S 
      bioactivity while aiding control of oxidative stress - may be advisable for the 
      mothers.

AB  - Malignant cells frequently demonstrate an oncogenic-driven reliance on glycolytic 
      metabolism to support their highly proliferative nature. Overexpression of pyruvate 
      dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) may promote this unique metabolic signature of tumor 
      cells by inhibiting mitochondrial function. PDKs function to phosphorylate and 
      inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Silencing of PDK expression has 
      previously been shown to restore mitochondrial function and reduce tumor cell 
      proliferation. High dose Vitamin B1, or thiamine, possesses antitumor properties 
      related to its capacity to reduce PDH phosphorylation and promote its enzymatic 
      activity, presumably through PDK inhibition. Though a promising nutraceutical 
      approach for cancer therapy, thiamine's low bioavailability may limit clinical 
      effectiveness. Here, we have demonstrated exploiting the commercially available 
      lipophilic thiamine analogs sulbutiamine and benfotiamine increases thiamine's 
      anti-cancer effect in vitro. Determined by crystal violet proliferation assays, both 
      sulbutiamine and benfotiamine reduced thiamine's millimolar IC50 value to micromolar 
      equivalents. HPLC analysis revealed that sulbutiamine and benfotiamine significantly 
      increased intracellular thiamine and TPP concentrations in vitro, corresponding with 
      reduced levels of PDH phosphorylation. Through an ex vitro kinase screen, thiamine's 
      activated cofactor form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was found to inhibit the 
      function of multiple PDK isoforms. Attempts to maximize intracellular TPP by 
      exploiting thiamine homeostasis gene expression resulted in enhanced apoptosis in 
      tumor cells. Based on our in vitro evaluations, we conclude that TPP serves as the 
      active species mediating thiamine's inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation. 
      Pharmacologic administration of benfotiamine, but not sulbutiamine, reduced tumor 
      growth in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. It remains unclear if benfotiamine's 
      effects in vivo are associated with PDK inhibition or through an alternative 
      mechanism of action. Future work will aim to define the action of lipophilic 
      thiamine mimetics in vivo in order to translate their clinical usefulness as 
      anticancer strategies.

AB  - The aim of this 29-week randomized, positively and negatively controlled study was 
      to investigate whether a nutraceutical containing 1 g leucine and 13 mg pyridoxine 
      can enhance weight loss while maintaining lean muscle mass in obese dogs. 
      Twenty-four healthy, 2-year-old beagles were initially divided into obesification (n 
      = 18) or ideal body weight groups (n = 6). After obesification, the 18 dogs were 
      divided into three weight loss groups and fed one of the following over 12 weeks: 
      nutraceutical with canned adult diet (CAD; ObN), placebo with CAD (ObP), or a canned 
      therapeutic weight loss diet (WLD). Dogs in the ideal body weight (IBW) group were 
      fed maintenance calorie requirements with CAD over 12 weeks. Based on MANOVA, ObN 
      and WLD lost similar amounts of total weight (3.6 ± 0.9 vs. 4.4 ± 1.1 kg, 
      respectively) and fat mass (3.1 ± 0.6 vs. 3.9 ± 0.8 kg, respectively) after 12 weeks 
      of treatment, and more than ObP (1.1 ± 1.2 kg weight; 0.9 ± 1.0 kg fat; p < 0.0001). 
      These data show the nutraceutical is a promising option for successful weight loss 
      in dogs. Maintenance levels of CAD were able to induce weight loss without risk of 
      hypo- or anorexia, or the need to switch diets or restrict energy intake.

AB  - The highly contagious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a newborn infectious 
      member of the dangerous beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) following SARS and MERS-CoVs, 
      can be regarded as the most significant issue afflicting the whole world shortly 
      after December 2019. Considering CoVs as RNA viruses with a single-stranded RNA 
      genome (+ssRNA), the critical viral enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a 
      promising therapeutic target for the potentially fatal infection COVID-19. 
      Nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is a naturally occurring analogue of Niacin 
      (vitamin B3), is expected to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 due to its super 
      close structural similarity to the proven RdRp inhibitors. Thus, at the first phase 
      of the current molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies, we targeted 
      SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. On the next phase, SARS-CoV RdRp, human Angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2, Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and the SARS-CoV-2 Structural 
      Glycoproteins Spike, Nonstructural viral protein 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease, and 
      Papain-like protease were targeted using the docking simulation to find other 
      possible antiviral effects of NR serendipitously. In the current study, the resulted 
      scores from molecular docking and dynamics simulations as the primary determinative 
      factor as well as the observed reliable binding modes have demonstrated that 
      Nicotinamide Riboside and its active metabolite NMN can target human ACE2 and IMPDH, 
      along with the viral S(pro), M(pro), PL(pro), and on top of all, RdRp as a potential 
      competitive inhibitor.

      System.

AB  - The edible cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis and its chief biliprotein 
      C-Phycocyanin have shown protective activity in animal models of diverse human 
      health diseases, often reflecting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The 
      beneficial effects of C-Phycocyanin seem likely to be primarily attributable to its 
      covalently attached chromophore Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Within cells, biliverdin is 
      generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although 
      bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity 
      reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin 
      can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may 
      explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent 
      models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene 
      coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant 
      enzymes, such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert 
      their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR 
      agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This 
      simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/antiinflammatory effects. 
      Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling 
      mediated by biliverdin reductase. This essay reviews recent research in which 
      CPhycocyanin and/or PCB, administered orally, parenterally, or intranasally, have 
      achieved marked protective effects in rodent and cell culture models of Ischemic 
      Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis, and suggests that these agents may likewise be 
      protective for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and in COVID-19 and its 
      neurological complications.

AB  - Starch nanoparticles from pearl (Pe) and proso (Pr) millets were characterised for 
      morphological, thermal, rheological and nutraceutical properties which are important 
      parameters to be considered for predicting applicable domain of nanoparticles in 
      food and other industrial applications. In the present study after using collision 
      ball milling to achieve the nano-reduction, dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed 
      the average hydrodynamic particle diameter of 636 nm and 417 nm for nano-reduced 
      pearl (PeN) and proso (PrN) millet starches. Further the nano-particles produced 
      were having greater stability, as revealed by the data obtained for zeta potential. 
      X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed loss of crystallinity in starch granules whereas 
      attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) 
      showed no difference in the basic functional groups but decrease in intensity. 
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to elicit the changes in surface 
      topography of starch granules upon nano-reduction. Post nano-reduction treatment 
      various thermal transition temperatures significantly shifted to lower values. 
      Results of anti-oxidant assays for prediction of nutraceutical potential revealed 
      significant increase upon nano-reduction.

AB  - Low levels of nutrient intake are common in industrialized countries. This has 
      negative implications on health and is associated with chronic diseases. 
      Supplementation of vitamins, minerals, and key nutrients to optimal levels may, 
      therefore, be beneficial for individual health and for the health economy. Although 
      the use of supplements has become very common, due to a lack of monitoring, there is 
      very limited data on the efficacy of supplementation with different formulas. In 
      this study, we present the results of a randomized controlled study on the efficacy 
      of a novel formulated nutraceutical, N247, in 250 healthy volunteers aged 26-75 
      years and a placebo control group (n = 35). The broad-spectrum formulation of N247 
      includes essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that are adequately 
      balanced in regard to synergies and related metabolic functions. Moreover, 
      tolerance, safety, and nutrient availability is an important aspect of daily, 
      long-term use of N247. After 3 months of regular N247 use, levels of vitamins and 
      minerals in serum were significantly increased in the N247 group compared with the 
      control group and a placebo group, with excellent compliance rates. Coupled with 
      additional natural ingredients that aim to increase the potency of the nutrients, 
      N247 may represent a novel and beneficial supplement for individuals with 
      nutritional deficiencies. Clinical Trial Registration:https://clinicaltrials.gov/,

AB  - The organ-specific accumulation, spatial distribution, and chemical speciation of 
      selenium (Se) were previously unknown for any species of cactus. We investigated Se 
      in Opuntia ficus-indica using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, 
      microfocused x-ray fluorescence elemental and chemical mapping (μXRF), Se K-edge 
      x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, and liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). μXRF showed Se concentrated inside small 
      conic, vestigial leaves (cladode tips), the cladode vasculature, and the seed 
      embryos. Se K-edge XANES demonstrated that approximately 96% of total Se in cladode, 
      fruit juice, fruit pulp, and seed is carbon-Se-carbon (C-Se-C). Micro and bulk XANES 
      analysis showed that cladode tips contained both selenate and C-Se-C forms. 
      Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry quantification of Se in 
      high-performance liquid chromatography fractions followed by LC-MS structural 
      identification showed selenocystathionine-to-selenomethionine (SeMet) ratios of 
      75:25, 71:29, and 32:68, respectively in cladode, fruit, and seed. Enzymatic 
      digestions and subsequent analysis confirmed that Se was mainly present in a "free" 
      nonproteinaceous form inside cladode and fruit, while in the seed, Se was 
      incorporated into proteins associated with lipids. μXRF chemical mapping illuminated 
      the specific location of Se reduction and assimilation from selenate accumulated in 
      the cladode tips into the two LC-MS-identified C-Se-C forms before they were 
      transported into the cladode mesophyll. We conclude that Opuntia is a secondary 
      Se-accumulating plant whose fruit and cladode contain mostly free 
      selenocystathionine and SeMet, while seeds contain mainly SeMet in protein. When 
      eaten, the organic Se forms in Opuntia fruit, cladode, and seed may improve health, 
      increase Se mineral nutrition, and help prevent multiple human cancers.

AB  - Nanoparticles were synthesized from soy protein, one of the most abundant and widely 
      utilized plant proteins, for nutraceutical and drug encapsulation. The preparation 
      process consisted of dispersion, desolvation, drug incorporation, cross-linking, and 
      evaporation. The role of each procedure in the formation of nanoparticles was 
      systematically investigated by means of particle size, size distribution, and zeta 
      potential as well as morphology observation. Curcumin as a model drug was 
      encapsulated successfully into the nanoparticles, evidenced by Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns. The average size of the 
      curcumin-loaded nanoparticles was 220.1 to 286.7 nm, and their zeta potential was 
      around -36 mV. The highest encapsulation efficiency and loading efficiency achieved 
      were 97.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The release of curcumin in phosphate buffer 
      saline followed a biphasic pattern. Possible mechanisms of the formation of soy 
      protein nanoparticles as well as the incorporation of curcumin were discussed based 
      on the data obtained from this study.

      derived extract for nutraceutical applications.
PG  - 6687-98

AB  - Maple syrup has nutraceutical potential given the macronutrients (carbohydrates, 
      primarily sucrose), micronutrients (minerals and vitamins), and phytochemicals 
      (primarily phenolics) found in this natural sweetener. We conducted compositional 
      (ash, fiber, carbohydrates, minerals, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, 
      phytochemicals), in vitro biological, and in vivo safety (animal toxicity) studies 
      on maple syrup extracts (MSX-1 and MSX-2) derived from two declassified maple syrup 
      samples. Along with macronutrient and micronutrient quantification, thirty-three 
      phytochemicals were identified (by HPLC-DAD), and nine phytochemicals, including two 
      new compounds, were isolated and identified (by NMR) from MSX. At doses of up to 
      1000 mg/kg/day, MSX was well tolerated with no signs of overt toxicity in rats. MSX 
      showed antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay) and 
      anti-inflammatory (in RAW 264.7 macrophages) effects and inhibited glucose 
      consumption (by HepG2 cells) in vitro. Thus, MSX should be further investigated for 
      potential nutraceutical applications given its similarity in chemical composition to 
      pure maple syrup.

TI  - Enhancing Nutraceutical Bioavailability from Raw and Cooked Vegetables Using 
      Excipient Emulsions: Influence of Lipid Type on Carotenoid Bioaccessibility from 
      Carrots.
PG  - 10508-17
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04691 [doi]
AB  - The influence of the nature of the lipid phase in excipient emulsions on the 
      bioaccessibility and transformation of carotenoid from carrots was investigated 
      using a gastrointestinal tract (GIT) model. Excipient emulsions were fabricated 
      using whey protein as an emulsifier and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), fish oil, 
      or corn oil as the oil phase. Changes in particle size, charge, and microstructure 
      were measured as the carrot-emulsion mixtures were passed through simulated mouth, 
      stomach, and small intestine regions. Carotenoid bioaccessibility depended on the 
      type of lipids used to form the excipient emulsions (corn oil > fish oil ≫ MCT), 
      which was attributed to differences in the solubilization capacity of mixed micelles 
      formed from different lipid digestion products. The transformation of carotenoids 
      was greater for fish oil and corn oil than for MCT, which may have been due to 
      greater oxidation or isomerization. The bioaccessibility of the carotenoids was 
      higher from boiled than raw carrots, which was attributed to greater disruption of 
      the plant tissue facilitating carotenoid release. In conclusion, excipient emulsions 
      are highly effective at increasing carotenoid bioaccessibility from carrots, but 
      lipid type must be optimized to ensure high efficacy.

TI  - Milk-based nutraceutical for treating autoimmune arthritis via the stimulation of 
      IL-10- and TGF-β-producing CD39+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - e0117825
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0117825 [doi]
LID - e0117825
AB  - Autoimmune diseases arise from the loss of tolerance to self, and because the 
      etiologies of such diseases are largely unknown, symptomatic treatments rely on 
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Tolerogenic treatments that can reverse 
      disease are preferred, but again, often thwarted by not knowing the responsible 
      auto-antigens (auto-Ags). Hence, a viable alternative to stimulating regulatory T 
      cells (Tregs) is to induce bystander tolerance. Colonization factor antigen I 
      (CFA/I) has been shown to evoke bystander immunity and to hasten Ag-specific Treg 
      development independent of auto-Ag. To translate in treating human autoimmune 
      diseases, the food-based Lactococcus was engineered to express CFA/I fimbriae, and 
      Lactococcus-CFA/I fermented milk fed to arthritic mice proved highly efficacious. 
      Protection occurred via CD39+ Tregs producing TGF-β and IL-10 to potently suppress 
      TNF-α production and neutrophil influx into the joints. Thus, these data demonstrate 
      the feasibility of oral nutraceuticals for treating arthritis, and potency of 
      protection against arthritis was improved relative to that obtained with 
      Salmonella-CFA/I.

TI  - Rationale for a novel nutraceutical complex 'K-water': potassium taurine bicarbonate 
      (PTB).
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Potassium taurine bicarbonate (PTB), an equimolar blend of potassium bicarbonate and 
      taurine, provides a convenient and feasible means of delivering physiologically 
      significant doses of potassium, taurine, and organic base when dissolved in water 
      ("K-water"). This brief essay reviews the versatile and complementary health 
      benefits that likely would accrue in individuals making regular use of K-water; in 
      particular, an adequate intake of PTB could be expected to aid blood pressure 
      control, lessen risk for atherosclerosis and its thromboembolic complications 
      (particularly stroke), promote maintenance of bone density, help to prevent calcium 
      renal stones, and possibly reduce risk for weight gain and diabetes.

TI  - An acidic polysaccharide (AGC3) isolated from North American ginseng (Panax 
      quinquefolius) suspension culture as a potential immunomodulatory nutraceutical.
PG  - 207-216
LID - 10.1016/j.crfs.2020.07.002 [doi]
AB  - Polysaccharides isolated from Panax quinquefolius roots are widely used as 
      nutraceuticals due to their immunomodulatory properties. Despite their popularity, 
      several challenges exist in isolating ginseng root polysaccharides such as 
      batch-to-batch structural inconsistencies and bacterial endotoxin contamination. A 
      plant tissue culture-based platform offers a potential solution to isolate natural 
      polysaccharide fractions with consistent chemical characteristics and reduced 
      endotoxin content. In this study, an acidic polysaccharide fraction (AGC3) with 
      immunomodulatory properties was isolated from Panax quinquefolius suspension 
      cultures. The heterogeneous fraction (molecular weight: 4.81 and 32.14 kDa), 
      purified by anion exchange chromatography, was predominantly composed of galactose 
      (>60%) along with the presence of rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, glucuronic acid and 
      galacturonic acid. The major glycosidic linkages were found to be t-Galp (47.7%), 
      4-Galp (15.6%), 2,4-Rhap (8.1%), 6-Galp (8.1%) and 4-GalAp (6.8%). Structural 
      analyses indicated the presence of a pectic rhamnogalacturonan I polysaccharide in 
      AGC3. AGC3 significantly (p < 0.05) stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells and 
      primary murine splenocytes by enhancing the production of several immunomodulatory 
      mediators such as IL-6, TNF-α, GM-CSF and MCP-1. The results also indicated the 
      putative roles of NF-κB (p65/RelA) and MAPK (p38) signaling pathways in the 
      immunostimulatory response. Additionally, AGC3 induced murine splenocyte 
      proliferation, another major indicator of immunostimulation. Overall, AGC3 has the 
      potential to be used as an immunostimulatory nutraceutical.

TI  - Toward prevention of Alzheimers disease--potential nutraceutical strategies for 
      suppressing the production of amyloid beta peptides.
PG  - 682-97
AB  - Alzheimers disease (AD) can be viewed as a vicious cycle in which excess production 
      and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides promote microglial activation, and 
      the resultant production of inflammatory mediators further boosts Abeta production 
      while inducing death and dysfunction of neurons. Abeta production is mediated by 
      beta- and gamma-secretase activities; it is prevented by alpha-secretase activity, 
      and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) catabolizes Abeta. High cellular cholesterol 
      content increases Abeta synthesis by boosting beta-secretase activity; inhibition of 
      cholesterol syntheses and/or stimulation of cholesterol export thus diminishes Abeta 
      production. PPARgamma activity decreases Abeta production by promoting harmless 
      catabolism of amyloid precursor protein while blocking the up-regulatory impact of 
      cytokines on beta-secretase expression. Nitric oxide produced by the healthy 
      cerebral microvasculature can suppress Abeta production by boosting expression of 
      alpha-secretase while suppressing that of beta-secretase; conversely, cerebral 
      ischemia provokes increased APP expression. Good insulin sensitivity and efficient 
      brain insulin function protect by inhibiting gamma-secretase activity and increasing 
      expression of IDE. The DHA provided by fish oil diminishes cerebral Abeta deposition 
      in rodent AD models, for unclear reasons. Various measures which oppose microglial 
      activation can inhibit up-regulation of beta-secretase and gamma-secretase by 
      oxidants and cytokines, respectively. These considerations suggest that a number of 
      nutraceutical or lifestyle measures may have potential for preventing or slowing AD: 
      policosanol; 9-cis-beta-carotene; isomerized hops extract; DHA; measures which 
      promote efficient endothelial NO generation, such as low-salt/potassium-rich diets, 
      exercise training, high-dose folate, and flavanol-rich cocoa; chromium picolinate 
      and cinnamon extract as aids for insulin sensitivity; and various agents which can 
      oppose microglial activation, including vitamin D, genistein, and sesamin. The 
      impact of these measures on Abeta production in rodent models of AD should be 
      evaluated, with the intent of defining practical strategies for AD prevention.

AB  - Excessive dietary intake of Na (i.e., NaCl) contributes to hypertension, which is a 
      major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Normally, NaOH and HCl are used to 
      dissolve and precipitate, respectively, fish muscle proteins in isoelectric 
      solubilization/precipitation (ISP), therefore contributing to increased Na content 
      in the recovered fish protein isolates (FPI). Substitution of NaOH with KOH may 
      decrease the Na content in FPI and, thus, allow development of reduced-Na seafood 
      products. In this study, FPI was recovered with ISP using NaOH or KOH. In order to 
      develop a nutraceutical seafood product, the FPI was extracted with NaCl or 
      KCl-based salt substitute and subjected to cold- or heat-gelation. In addition, 
      standard nutraceutical additives (ω-3 fatty acids-rich oil and dietary fiber) along 
      with titanium dioxide (TiO2) were added to FPI. Color, texture, dynamic rheology, Na 
      and K content, and lipid oxidation of the FPI gels were compared to commercial 
      Alaska pollock surimi gels. FPI gels had greater (p < 0.05) whiteness, good color 
      properties (L*a*b*), and generally better textural properties when compared to 
      surimi gels. Although the ISP-recovered FPI and surimi developed similar final gel 
      elasticity, the proteins in FPI and surimi had different gelation pattern. A 
      reduction (p < 0.05) of Na content and simultaneous increase (p < 0.05) in K content 
      of FPI gels was achieved by the substitution of NaOH with KOH during ISP and NaCl 
      with the KCl-based salt substitute during formulation of the FPI paste. Although 
      cooking and addition of NaCl during formulation of the FPI paste increased (p < 
      0.05) lipid oxidation in FPI gels, TBARS values were much below rancidity levels. 
      These results indicate that KOH can replace NaOH to recover FPI from whole gutted 
      fish for subsequent development of nutraceutical seafood products tailored for 
      reduction of diet-driven cardiovascular disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of an orally administered 
      nutraceutical (Glu/CS+; + for additional ingredient) for the treatment of clinical 
      osteoarthritis (OA) in dogs. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, client-owned dogs with clinical signs of OA in 
      one or more joints were assigned to a Glu/CS+ (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) group. 
      Dogs were administered Glu/CS+ or placebo orally and wore an activity monitor (AM) 
      continuously throughout a 97 day study period. Prior to the initiation of the 
      treatment, seven days of baseline activity was collected. On days -7, 30, 60 and 90 
      of the study, owners completed a patient assessment form (Canine Brief Pain 
      Inventory). Data between groups were compared. RESULTS: No serious adverse events 
      were reported. No difference was found between groups when evaluating daily activity 
      counts during the seven-day pre-treatment period and the 90-day treatment period. 
      Owner assessment (pain interference and pain severity scores) improved over the 
      90-day treatment period for both groups, however no difference was found between 
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with oral Glu/CS+ for a 90 day treatment 
      period when compared to placebo treatment did not result in a significant increase 
      in activity counts in dogs with clinical OA. However, owner assessment scores 
      similarly improved throughout the study period for dogs in both groups, suggesting a 
      caregiver placebo effect in this outcome measure.

AB  - Exposure to nerve agents results in severe seizures or status epilepticus caused by 
      the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, a critical enzyme that breaks down 
      acetylcholine to terminate neurotransmission. Prolonged seizures cause brain damage 
      and can lead to long-term consequences. Current countermeasures are only modestly 
      effective against the brain damage supporting interest in the evaluation of new and 
      efficacious therapies. The nutraceutical alpha-linolenic acid (LIN) is an essential 
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that has a wide safety margin. Previous work 
      showed that a single intravenous injection of alpha-linolenic acid (500 nmol/kg) 
      administered before or after soman significantly protected against soman-induced 
      brain damage when analyzed 24h after exposure. Here, we show that administration of 
      three intravenous injections of alpha-linolenic acid over a 7 day period after soman 
      significantly improved motor performance on the rotarod, enhanced memory retention, 
      exerted an anti-depressant-like activity and increased animal survival. This dosing 
      schedule significantly reduced soman-induced neuronal degeneration in four major 
      vulnerable brain regions up to 21 days. Taken together, alpha-linolenic acid reduces 
      the profound behavioral deficits induced by soman possibly by decreasing neuronal 
      cell death, and increases animal survival.

AB  - Rodent studies reveal that oxidative stress, much of it generated via 
      induction/activation of NADPH oxidase, is a key mediator of a number of the 
      pathogenic effects of chronic ethanol overconsumption. The highly reactive ethanol 
      metabolite acetaldehyde is a key driver of this oxidative stress, and doubtless 
      works in other ways to promote alcohol-induced pathology. Effective antioxidant 
      measure may therefore be useful for mitigating the adverse health consequences of 
      alcohol consumption; spirulina may have particular utility in this regard, as its 
      chief phycochemical phycocyanobilin has recently been shown to function as an 
      inhibitor of certain NADPH oxidase complexes, mimicking the physiological role of 
      its chemical relatives biliverdin/bilirubin in this respect. Moreover, certain 
      nutraceuticals, including taurine, pantethine, and lipoic acid, may have the 
      potential to boost the activity of the mitochondrial isoform of aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase, ALDH-2, accelerating conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate (which 
      arguably has protective health effects). Little noticed clinical studies conducted 
      nearly three decades ago reported that pre-ingestion of either taurine or pantethine 
      could blunt the rise in blood acetaldehyde following ethanol consumption. Other 
      evidence suggests that lipoic acid may function within mitochondria to maintain 
      aldehyde dehydrogenase in a reduced active conformation; the impact of this agent on 
      ethanol metabolism has however received little or no study. Studies evaluating the 
      impact of nutracetical strategies on prevention of hangovers - which likely are 
      mediated by acetaldehyde - may represent a quick, low-cost way to identify 
      nutraceutical regimens that merit further attention for their potential impact on 
      alcohol-induced pathology. Measures which boost or preserve ALDH-2 activity may also 
      have important antioxidant potential, as this enzyme functions physiologically to 
      protect cells from toxic aldehydes generated by oxidant stress.
